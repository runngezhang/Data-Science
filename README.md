Communications Research
=====
This project under 'Communications-Research' analyses trends in wireless communications research from 2002-2012. Meta-data of major conferences and journals are obtained from the IEEE database. The citations are then obtained from Microsoft Academic Search (programmatically) and Google Scholar (manually). The location of the primary authors of the papers are also obtained from the MaxMind world cities database (programmatically) and Google (manually). All this information is analysed to obtain trends in the past decade.
