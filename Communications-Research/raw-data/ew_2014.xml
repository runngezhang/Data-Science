<abstract><![CDATA[The ever increasing demand for ubiquitous wireless connectivity and the inherently limited power resources at mobile devices highlight the need for an energy efficient operation of these devices. The paper addresses this need by means of an appropriate handover policy. According to it, a handover is initiated whenever the energy efficiency of the user equipment falls below a given threshold. The handover target is selected among the candidates so as to maximize the achievable energy efficiency. For networks employing Proportionally Fair access, it is shown that the achievable energy efficiency can be calculated by means of a simple expression, requiring only a limited amount of network and terminal status information. In particular, no network load status is required. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed handover policy can lead to a significantly improved (up to 15%) energy efficiency without compromising throughput performance.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Random linear network coding (RLNC) has been shown to provide increased throughput, security and robustness for the transmission of data through the network. Most of the analysis and the demonstrators have focused on the study of data packets with the same size (number of bytes). This constitutes a best case scenario as coded packets will incur little overhead to handle such packets. However, packet lengths are quite heterogeneous in real networks, which can cause a high overhead or, alternatively, a high delay in the transmission of data packets. As we show, this can have a severe effect on a variety of applications. This paper proposes a series of mechanisms to manage heterogeneous packet lengths and analyzes the induced overhead of those mechanisms using real packet length distributions provided by CAIDA and own measurements using video content. Our results show that an appropriate packetization of the data packets can reduce the overhead from over 100% (zero-padding packets) to below 5% for CAIDA packet distributions and that the right choice of parameters can reduce the overhead to less than 10% in the case of video data.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Cognitive Radio (CR) has matured as a research field and has the goal to improve the utilization of spectrum. This technology enables a CR user to function in unlicensed or licensed bands without causing interference to primary users. In order to achieve this functionality a CR user needs to sense the spectrum and exploit efficiently the transmission opportunities. In this paper we propose two heuristic sensing algorithms for adhoc CR networks with low computational requirements, where each user tries to exploit ??spectrum holes?? based only on its own observations. The first algorithm refers to an immediate reward approach, according to which, each time a ??spectrum hole?? is detected, it is used instantaneously. The second refers to an immediate-versus-future-reward approach, where the CR may wait to sense the next channel instead of transmitting in the current one, if the expected reward when using the next channel is greater than the instant. In our proposed algorithms we examine both known and unknown statistics of channels. For the case of unknown channel parameters we introduce an initial sensing time and we investigate through simulations the impact of different sensing periods on the system's throughput.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Active Antenna System (AAS) technology has the capability of deployment options with dynamic capacity provisioning. One of the features of AAS is high flexibility with respect to antenna tilt control via adapting the orientation of the antenna beam, which improves the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) performance to satisfy capacity demand in a non-uniform and spatiotemporally varying traffic distribution. Efficient tilt adaptation in capacity optimization requires identifying the dominant interferer cells rather than considering all neighboring cells of a certain target area. In this paper, considering AAS deployment, the performance of tilt optimization driven by heterogeneous user traffic distribution is investigated by applying a tilt optimization algorithm on selected candidate potential interferer cells. In order to identify these interferer cells, a technique called dominant interferer cell identification is proposed, assuming the presence of a high user traffic concentration (traffic hotspot) in a certain location and periodical user measurement reports at the base station. Moreover, by utilizing the periodic report statistics from users a mechanism to make a network aware of the presence of a traffic hotspot (HS) situation is also proposed. Investigations have been conducted using a 3GPP model and Ray tracing based realworld scenarios. Simulation results have shown that the proposed technique gives a reduced number of dominant interferer cells as compared to a default scheme, which considers all the neighboring cells of a cell serving the target area. In addition, it has also shown a significant performance improvement with a reduced set of dominant interferer cells.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Wireless image transmission presents a particular challenge for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), due to a limited energy budget of wireless sensor nodes. The motivation of our study is an implementation of high-resolution cameras in WSNs for pest monitoring. We are interested in choosing a wireless communication protocol that minimizes the node's energy consumption, and provides a reliable transfer of a raw high-resolution image from the end device mounted in the field to the remote server where the image will be processed. We test how collisions, data transfer rate limitation and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) influence the energy-efficiency of IEEE 802.15.4 and the IEEE 802.11b/g protocols. Results show that IEEE 802.11 protocol is more energy-efficient than IEEE 802.15.4. The energy consumption is decreasing with the increment of bit rate. On the other hand, communication with a higher bit rate is more susceptible to bit errors for low SNR values. Thus, for both reliable and energy-efficient image transmission, IEEE 802.11 protocol with intermediate bit rates should be used, resulting with estimated node lifetime of 441 days.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Duty cycle control is applied in IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control (MAC) protocol to reduce energy consumption. A low duty cycle improves the energy efficiency but it reduces the available transmission time, thereby increases the end-to-end delay. Thus, it is a challenge issue to achieve a good trade-off between energy efficiency and delay. In this paper, we study a duty cycle control problem with the aim of minimising the joint-cost of energy consumption and end-to-end delay. By applying dynamic programming (DP), the optimal duty cycle control is derived. Furthermore, to ensure the feasibility of implementing the control on computation limited sensor devices, a low complexity rollout algorithm based duty cycle control (RADutyCon) is proposed. The joint-cost upper bound of the proposed RADutyCon is investigated. Simulation results show that RADutyCon can effectively reduces the joint-cost of energy consumption and end-to-end delay under various network traffic. In addition, RADutyCon achieves an exponential reduction of computation complexity compared with DP optimal control.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Cognitive Radio is a broadly discussed approach for better spectrum utilization by allowing Secondary Users (SU) the temporary usage of non-occupied spectrum licensed to Primary Users (PU). With the Non-Contiguous OFDM transmission technique even strongly fragmented spectrum can be efficiently accessed by SUs. In this paper, we consider a set of independent, autonomous groups of SUs (networks consisting of a base station and a set of client stations) to operate in a shared set of temporary reusable frequencies. We present a fair, distributed spectrum allocation algorithm with low computational complexity and low control data overhead. Our approach assures that in case a PU is reclaiming some spectrum this will affect all co-located SU groups in the same fair manner. Simulation results demonstrate the convincing efficiency of this algorithm as compared with a centralized, optimal solution.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Wireless transceivers must perform adequately when the channel conditions are in worst case. However, when signal and interference conditions are favorable, the transceiver may consume more energy than required. Therefore, a reconfigurable transceiver (transmitter + receiver), able to adjust its corresponding power consumption to the time-varying signal and interference conditions, could have a decisive impact on the lifetime of the sensor node. In this paper, novel strategies for receiver reconfiguration are presented. Secondly a simulation framework for wireless sensor networks (WSN), EnvAdapt, equipped with reconfigurable transceiver models and an enhanced bit-level signal to noise-plus interference-ratio module, is proposed. Finally, via EnvAdapt, WSN scenarios are considered to show that the receiver reconfiguration can help reduce power consumption, thus extending the lifetime of the sensor node.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The Self-Organizing Network (SON) has been seen as one of the promising areas to save OPerational EXpenditure (OPEX) and to bring real efficiency to the wireless networks. Though the studies in literature concern with local interaction and distributed structure for SON, study on its coherent pattern has not yet been well-conducted. We consider a target-following regime and propose a novel approach of goal attainment using Similarity Measure (SM) for Coverage & Capacity Optimization (CCO) use-case in SON. The methodology is based on a self-optimization algorithm, which optimizes the multiple objective functions of UE throughput and fairness using performance measure, which is carried out using SM between target and measured KPIs. After certain epochs, the optimum results are used in adjustment and updating modules of goal attainment. To investigate the proposed approach, a simulation in downlink LTE has also been set up. In a scenario including a congested cell with hot-spot, the joint antenna parameters of tilt/azimuth using a 3D beam pattern is considered. The final CDF results show a noticeable migration of hot-spot UEs to higher throughputs, while no one worse off.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, we consider a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) wireless network composed of a group of devices which duty cycle to save energy. These devices operate in low-power sleeping mode for most of the time and, periodically, they wake-up to listen to a poll packet transmitted by a data collector. Upon this broadcast poll, all devices try to get access to the uplink channel to transmit a burst of data packets. Therefore, the idle network is suddenly set into saturation conditions when all devices wake up and attempt to get access to the channel simultaneously. The Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol used to coordinate these transmissions has a strong influence on the energy efficiency of the network, and thus the lifetime of the devices. Frame Slotted ALOHA (FSA) has been identified in the literature as a simple yet efficient MAC protocol for such kind of communications. However, when the devices have to transmit more than one data packet per channel invocation, the Reservation Frame Slotted- ALOHA (RFSA) may be more efficient, since it guarantees the collision-free transmission of data for a device once it succeeds for the first time. Existing analyzes of both FSA and RFSA are valid for steady traffic conditions and not for abrupt idle-to-saturation traffic patterns. Motivated by this fact, in this paper we evaluate the energy efficiency of RFSA through computerbased simulations to show its better performance compared to FSA. Results show that RFSA can attain up to 48% energy gains compared to FSA, thus extending the lifetime of data-collection M2M networks.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Although maximal-ratio combining (MRC) has become a widespread diversity-combining technique, its performance under interference is still not very well understood. Since the interference received at each antenna originates from the same set of interferers, but partially de-correlates over the fading channel, it exhibits a complicated correlation structure across antennas. Using tools from stochastic geometry, this work develops a realistic analysis capturing the interference correlation effects for dual-branch MRC receivers in a downlink cellular system. Modeling the base station locations by a Poisson point process, the probability of a typical dual-branch MRC receiver being covered by its serving base station is derived. For the interference-limited case, this result can be further simplified to an easy-to-use single-integral expression. Using this result, it is shown that ignoring interference correlation overestimates the true performance by 3%-10%, while assuming identical interference levels across antennas underestimates it by <2%. In both cases, however, the true diversity order of dual-branch MRC is preserved. Finally, the performance of MRC and selection combining under spatial interference correlation is compared.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Video surveillance and similar real-time applications on wireless networks require increased reliability and high performance of the underlying transmission layer. Classical solutions, such as Reed-Solomon codes, increase the reliability, but typically have the negative side-effect of additional overall delays due to processing overheads. This paper describes the delay reduction achieved through online network coding approaches with a limit on the number of packets to be mixed before decoding and a systematic encoding structure. We use the inorder per packet delay as our key performance metric. This metric captures the elapsed time between (network) encoding RTP packets and completely decoding the packets in-order on the receiver side. Our solutions are implemented and evaluated on a point-to-point link between a Raspberry Pi device and a network (de)coding enabled software running on a regular PC. We find that our sliding window approach (more feedback) outperforms all other tested mechanisms in terms of per-+packet delay including the Reed-Solomon encoding employing the systematic approach, a random linear network coding approach, and our proposed on-the-fly network coding approach (which relies on less feedback).We show gains in order of magnitudes between our sliding window and the other approaches when we manage the redundancy transmission adaptively. This low per-packet delay and the inherent reliability of our schemes make these solutions particularly suitable for real-time multimedia delivery in contrast to other classical and network coding strategies.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Requirement for low operating and deployment costs of cellular networks motivate the need for self-organisation in cellular networks. To reduce operational costs, self-organising networks are fast becoming a necessity. One key issue in this context is self-organised coverage estimation that is done based on the signal strength measurement and reported position information of system users. In this paper, the effect of inaccurate position estimation on self-organised coverage estimation is investigated. We derive the signal reliability expression (i.e. probability of the received signal being above a certain threshold) and the cell coverage expressions that take the error in position estimation into consideration. This is done for both the shadowing and non-shadowing channel models. The accuracy of the modified reliability and cell coverage probability expressions are also numerically verified for both cases.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[It is well known that wireless networks are vulnerable to passive attacks such as eavesdropping due to the broadcast nature of the wireless communication channel. As a countermeasure to such attacks, beamforming and artificial noise approaches are frequently resorted to. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization problem for beamforming, user scheduling, and base station assignment in a multicell network from secrecy perspective. Our proposed methodology tailors the ambient interference to act as artificial noise hence increases the secrecy capacity. We also extent the optimization problem to a more generalized case to include artificial noise at the base stations to further enhance the secrecy of the multicell network. Via simulations, we show that proposed systems enhance secrecy capacity when compared to the existing solutions.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper proposes a novel adaptive transmission scheme based on the uniform channel decomposition (UCD)-based that enables multiuser MIMO-OFDM gains to be realized while remaining fully compliant with the latest IEEE 802.11ac draft. In particular, the proposed technique takes into account the availability of a finite modulation and coding set and the restrictions concerning the transmission mode selection defined in IEEE 802.11ac. Users are selected using a proportionally fair scheduling algorithm and the UCD is adaptively optimized to allocate a number of per-user subchannels maximizing the system throughput. Simulation results in the context of IEEE 802.11ac confirm the advantage of the UCD approach when compared to the conventional singular value decomposition (SVD)-based approach.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We propose a novel scheme for physical-layer network coding (PNC), constructed from linear block codes for multiple-user multiple-relay wireless networks. In the proposed design, each relay computes a linear combination of source symbols, namely, the network coded symbol (NCS) and forwards it to the destination. The destination collects all NCSs and the original source symbols to form a valid codeword of the linear code. The resulting codeword can be decoded to reliably extract the original source symbols. The numerical results show that our proposed design provides m-th order diversity when there are m relays. Moreover, the proposed design provides a significant sumrate enhancement over the orthogonal multiple access scheme with network coding described in previous literature.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Network Quality-of-Service (QoS) in terms of capacity can be brought about by enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (eICIC). eICIC techniques are gaining interest these days due to the ability to mitigate the interference at the cell-edge of the low power nodes (typically pico cells) by blocking sub-frame transmissions of the high power nodes (macro cells). In our previous work, we had proposed a novel technique for centralized self-optimization using an iterative surrogate management framework which involves the iterative use of: 1-a surrogate to model the functional relationship between the Network Parameters (NPs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and 2- a subsequent use of a pattern search algorithm for eICIC optimization. The study assumed that the traffic was not varying in intensity over the optimization period. In this work we propose to introduce: 1- a time-varying traffic eICIC optimization scenario and 2- a new optimization algorithm based on the ??Expectation of Improvement?? criteria within the surrogate management framework. Results using a system level network simulator reveals the practicality of the proposed optimization approach for varying traffic and also demonstrates the superiority of the Expected Improvement algorithm in terms of incorporating the uncertainty of the noisy KPI observations during the optimization process.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Channel estimation for multicarrier modulations often requires interpolation to recover the complete channel response. This paper investigates a new method adapted to fragmented spectrum usage where an efficient interpolation scheme for the complete spectrum including the edges is critical. The interpolation is performed in the frequency domain by introducing different interpolation filters on the edges. A theoretical problem description helps to derive a set of key optimization equations used for filter construction. The potential gain of this new method is then simulated for Filterbank Multicarrier (FBMC) modulations. Up to 7dB estimation improvement is observed on state-of-the-art interpolation techniques.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Conventional downlink signals in massive MIMO suffer from high PAR, which requires the power amplifiers of the base station to be backed off to avoid signal distortion, which lowers power efficiency. To improve efficiency, there are precoding schemes that produce signals with low PAR. To compare different precoding schemes, this article estimates their power consumptions through simulations, in which in-band distortion and amplifier efficiency effects are taken into consideration. It is found that, when only in-band distortion and the data rate requirement determine the back-off, the inband distortion is negligible and the power amplifiers can be operated at peak efficiency. It also turns out that low-PAR and conventional, high-PAR, precoding schemes consume approximately the same amount of power when the out-of-band part of the distortion is disregarded.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Base station cooperation is a powerful technique for eliminating inter-cell interference and enhancing spectral efficiency in cellular networks. However, impairment effects due to channel estimation, feedback quantization, channel time variance as well as imperfect carrier and sampling frequencies among base stations are limiting the potential gains. This paper provides a unifying framework for modeling these impairments in cooperative multi-user multi-cellular systems, for analyzing the performance degradation due to the resulting inter-user interference and finally for mitigating impairments. Evaluation of the performance degradation reveals how critical impairments are. Multi-cell channel estimation, clustering and feedback compression are investigated as mitigation tools, while it is shown that advanced channel prediction and synchronization of distributed base stations can also compensate the performance degradation. In this way, limitations in mobility, feedback delay and number of supported users can be relaxed, which makes base station cooperation a practical and highly attractive technique.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The symmetric 3-user interference channel is studied with the goal of characterizing its capacity region in the strong interference regime within a constant gap. To this end, a transmission scheme combining rate-splitting and interference alignment is proposed, and its achievable rate is derived. Next it is shown that the proposed scheme achieves the so-called greedy-max corner points of the capacity region within a constant gap. By combining this result with previous results on the sumcapacity of the interference channel, a constant gap characterization of the capacity region for the strong interference regime is obtained.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, we address the phase of radio network planning and optimization (RNPO) related to base station (BS) deployment in the presence of femtocell access points (FAPs). After determining an approximate number of required BSs from the dimensioning phase, we place these BSs on the geographical area of interest, and optimize their location based on low complexity heuristic techniques. An important constraint to be taken into account is that the location of FAPs is user-dependent and is beyond the control of the mobile network operator. In this paper, we consider heterogeneous network planning; i.e., the operator has to place a combination of macrocell and small cell BSs in a way to optimize the coverage and capacity of the network. The operator can control the placement of the macro and small cell BSs, but has no control over the locations and operation of FAPs.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper proposes the theoretical derivation method of the bit error rate (BER) performance for uplink Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) employing space diversity reception under nonlinear fading channels. The proposed method provides the simple series form formula which takes into account the space diversity benefit as well as two different subcarrier allocation methods such as localized FDMA (LFDMA) and interleaved FDMA (IFDMA). Hence, the proposed formula makes it possible to easily confirm the performance difference between LFDMA and IFDMA while computer simulations require high computational complexity. The validity of the proposed formula is confirmed by the agreement with the computer simulation results under various kinds of system parameters such as the subcarrier allocation methods, the number of MSs, the number of antennas, and the input back-off(IBO).]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This work proposes a new protocol applying on-the-fly random linear network coding in wireless mesh networks. The protocol provides increased reliability, low delay, and high throughput to the upper layers, while being oblivious to their specific requirements. This seemingly conflicting goals are achieved by design, using an on-the-fly network coding strategy. Our protocol also exploits relay nodes to increase the overall performance of individual links. Since our protocol naturally masks random packet losses from the upper layers, it makes it particularly suitable for enhancing TCP's performance in wireless mesh networks, where packet losses are typically interpreted as a sign of congestion by TCP's congestion control algorithms, thus crippling TCP's throughput. To investigate the gains and downsides of our protocol, we implement it as a configurable proof-of-concept application, which is deployed and evaluated in a real test bed with Raspberry Pi devices. We show that order of magnitude gains in throughput over plain TCP are possible with moderate losses and up to two fold improvement in per packet delay in our results.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In order to support high-data-rate wireless communication links, millimeter wave (mmWave) systems need to overcome considerable propagation attenuation. In mmWave systems, the small wavelength enables pre-processing exploiting large antenna arrays to provide the required gain. Generally, in traditional microwave systems, pre-processing is done at the digital baseband. However, the cost and power consumption of a radio frequency (RF) chain, which carries out translation between RF and digital baseband, is too high. It is impossible to afford one for each antenna element. This hardware limitation places additional constraints on pre-processing design. In this paper, we use hybrid spatial processing architecture with a lower number of RF chains than the antenna elements. We propose a joint design of digital baseband pre-processing and post-processing based on a weighted minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion subject to the transmit power constraint. Then, the optimization in the RF domain is specified into three criteria according to various error weights. For ease of hardware implementation, we develop a lower complexity transceiver in which pre-processing in RF domain after upconversion is implemented merely using analog phase shifters. Finally, we evaluate our proposed scheme by means of simulation.]]></abstract>

In particular, the model accounts for uncertainty such as random phenomena (e.g., fast fading) or inexact information (e.g., user location) to derive the statistical distribution of the user throughput. Such a model is highly useful for aiding scheduling and resource allocation decisions. In addition, we provide a taxonomy of prediction techniques to investigate error sources and the main characteristics of prediction accuracy. Finally, we show the versatility of the model by analyzing LTE user throughput for the case where knowledge of either the user's actual position or the congestion level in the cell is inexact.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In the near future, a massive deployment of LTE femtocells in indoor environments is expected, leading to a harmful interference in the femtocell tier and to a substantial increase of energy consumption on entire cellular network. In this paper we address these issues proposing a fully distributed measurement-based pilot power control algorithm for LTE femtocells embedded in a macrocell area. In our approach each Femto Base Station (FBS) autonomously self-configures and self-optimizes its cell radius according to the detected on-site user activity under interference constraints. The algorithm does not require any signaling exchange between BSs, making it attractive for practical use in the expected large-scale femtocell deployment.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper focuses on the analysis of the trade-off existing between achieved performance and observation requirements in a decision making framework based on the cognitive cycle. For that purpose, it presents a general belief based decision making framework that can be particularized for different observation strategies that decide when measurements are carried out to characterize the dynamics of the radio environment. While the concept can be applied to different cognitive radio problems, the paper focuses on the spectrum selection to establish a set of radio links. The considered observation strategies and associated decision making are assessed under different environment conditions in terms of the traffic generation patterns. Results reveal that both the session generation rate and the session duration play a key role to choose the adequate observation strategy that balances the achieved performance and the measurement requirements.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We study a joint linear precoder and decoder design in multicell multiuser with multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) system. The weighted mean square error (WMSE) minimization problem is studied in MU-MIMO interfering broadcast channel (IBC). Imperfect channel state information (CSI) due to channel estimation error at the receiver and antenna correlation at both MIMO-link ends is taken into account. Rayleigh fading with pathloss effect is considered in our system. Distance between base stations and distance from base station to its user equipments are taken into account. We propose an iterative algorithm to obtain a global minimum solution for expectation of WMSE minimization problem. The bisection method is used to find Lagrange multiplier value. Monte Carlo simulation method is used to obtain the results.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The K-user MIMO Y-channel consisting of K users which want to exchange messages among each other via a common relay node is studied in this paper. A transmission strategy based on channel diagonalization using zero-forcing beam-forming is proposed. This strategy is then combined with signal-space alignment for network-coding, and the achievable degrees-of-freedom region is derived. A new degrees-of-freedom outer bound is also derived and it is shown that the proposed strategy achieves this outer bound if the users have more antennas than the relay.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Anomaly detection is a key component in which perturbations from a normal behavior suggests a misconfigured/ mismatched data in related systems. In this paper, we present a call detail record based anomaly detection method (CADM) that analyzes the users's calling activities and detects the abnormal behavior of user movements in a real cellular network. CADM is capable of detecting the location of the site that an anomaly has occurred. We evaluate the proposed CADM by performing experiments over the call-detail records of AVEA, a mobile service provider in Turkey.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In a self-organized Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, different Self-Organizing Network (SON) functions can execute parallel actions which interact or collide among each other. When the effect of the interaction negatively affects the performances of the system, this is referred to in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as a SON conflict, which needs to be handled by means of a self-coordination framework. We focus in this paper on a functional architecture for the selfcoordination of different actions taken by different SON functions to be automatically executed in a self organized realistic LTE network. We propose a functional architecture and a theoretical framework based on the theory of Markov Decision Process (MDP)s. In order to cope with the size of the state spaces, we subdivide the Markov Decision problem modeling the eNB onto simpler subMDPs modeling the different SON functions. Each sub-problem is defined as an MDP and solved independently, and their individual policies are combined to obtain a global policy. This combined policy can execute several actions per state but can introduce policy conflicts. We focus on the specific SON conflict generated by the concurrent execution of multiple SON functions, which may require to update the same parameter. The coordination among the different actions selected by the conflicting use cases is achieved by means of two approaches. The first one is based on a modified policy iteration protocol. The second one is based on a coordination game where the players are the subMDPs and the actions and rewards are those provided by the independent subMDP solutions.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper addresses the link resource adaptation (LRA) problem for bit-interleaved coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems when the transmitter makes use of outdated channel state information (CSI). Differently from the capacity-based works recently appeared in the literature, our approach is to optimize the modulation format, coding rate and power distribution across the subcarriers by maximizing the system expected goodput (EGP). The main contributions basically rely on deriving a novel link performance prediction (LPP) method under outdated CSI, based on which an effective LRA strategy is developed. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing remarkable performance gains compared to the conventional approach which does not care of the outdated CSI.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, a novel non-contiguous non-systematic coded unique word (UW)-OFDM system is proposed to opportunistically transmit data on the spectrum holes available in a cognitive radio network. In such a system, the spectral sidelobes of the active subcarriers interfere with the adjacent spectral band used by the primary system. In the proposed scheme, the code generator matrix of the UW-OFDM is designed to suppress the sidelobes. So, there is no need to add any extra processing to the transmitter for suppressing sidelobes. The derived code generator matrix is optimum in the sense of being matched to the best linear unbiased estimator and to the linear minimum mean square error data estimators. The achieved sidelobe suppression is a function of the number of transmitted data symbols. Simulation results show that by a slight decrease in the number of transmitted data symbols, the sidelobes power can be suppressed to zero.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[High frequency data communication has its own typical characteristics. In this type of communication, free space is used as transmission medium and data is carried with electromagnetic radio waves to beyond-line-of-sight. Comparing with guided media types such as metallic/fiber-optic cables, or higher frequency radio waves, HF's bandwidth is considerably low. Also, HF radio waves are subjected to various types of noise and highly affected environmental changes. Hence, HF data communication requires special network protocols. STANAG 5066 is such a data link protocol which is designed to carry information efficiently between two or more HF nodes throughout the air. DMP is an application layer protocol and its objective is to transfer time-critical e-mails over several types of network at low bandwidths. In this paper, we discuss HF radio protocol stack implementations which involve DMP and STANAG 5066 for time-critical e-mail transfers. We compare usage of DMP over reliable and unreliable STANAG 5066. Also, we propose a ??fragment size change?? algorithm for DMP in order to enhance its usage over unreliable bearers for multicast and EMCON messages at high error rates.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Universal Filtered Multi-Carrier (UFMC) is a novel modulation technique which can be seen as a generalization of filtered OFDM and filter bank based multi-carrier (FBMCFMT). Being a candidate waveform technology for 5G wireless systems it combines the simplicity of OFDM with the advantages of FBMC. While previous work on UFMC was based on Dolph-Chebyshev-filters, in this paper we now optimize the FIR filter design, using two different optimization criteria. The first criterion is the maximization of the signal over out-of-band leakage ratio. The second criterion uses signal over in-band distortion plus out-of-band leakage ratio. We compare UFMC based on filters with those two optimization approaches against UFMC with Dolph-Chebyshev filters and against OFDM in a setting with non-perfect frequency alignment. The performance gains of the optimized filters are demonstrated in link level simulations. Both of the proposed approaches show significant performance gains over OFDM in terms of average SIR: Almost 10 dB and 7 dB SIR improvement can be achieved by using the first and second criterion, respectively.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication promises the full potential of MIMO communication realized through the deployment of hundreds of antennas at each base station. Accurate channel state information (CSI) is crucial for making the most of massive MIMO. In time-varying channels, however, if not periodically updated, CSI obtained at the base station becomes progressively outdated. In this paper, we formulate a training optimization problem for maximizing uplink sum-rates. The optimal training period and update interval are characterized as solutions to fixed-point equations, which depend on the normalized Doppler shift and large-scale channel coefficients. It is found that, for a sufficiently large number of antennas at each base station, the optimal training period is equal to the number of users per cell.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Microstrip antennas have been developed for various applications such as broadband High speed wireless communication systems and automotive radar systems. They are more advantageous than other millimeter-wave antennas at the viewpoints of low profile and low cost. As the target radar cross section (RCS) continuously decreases, the need for high gain radar increases. One approach to high gain is to use distributed subarray antennas (DSAs), because of limited surface available on many radar platforms. In this paper, the design and analysis of smart distributed subarray antennas has been introduced and analyzed. The analysis and design are done by a commercial software. The good agreement between the theoretical expectation and the simulation results is observed. Finally, the proposed optimum distributed subarray microstrip antenna design structure has been fabricated and the measured Sparameters of the proposed structure can be analyzed with network analyzer and compared with simulation results to demonstrate the excellent performance and meet the requirements for multifunction applications.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose two iterative synchronization schemes for distributed beamforming (DBF) with sidelobe control. The scenario that we address is that of a wireless sensor network surrounded by one intended base station (BS) and multiple unintended ones (serving otherWSNs). We consider two specific synchronization schemes with soft and hard constraints in terms of the received signal strength acceptable at the unintended base stations. The schemes merely require partial CSI at the BSs plus the broadcast of one-bit feedback messages from the intended BS messages to the sensor nodes.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The orthogonal assignment of radio resources in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems allows to exploit multiuser diversity in frequency and time domains. The instantaneous data rate estimated on each resource for each User Equipment (UE) by the scheduling policy needs to reflect accurately the data rate effectively achieved after power allocation. However, when the total amount of resources are allocated opportunistically by the scheduling policy without any constraint with respect to the number of frequency resources assigned to each UE, the transmit power on each resource may be unknown to the scheduling policy. Indeed, scheduling and power allocation are coupled by the transmit power. In this paper, a realistic prediction of the average transmit power for the frequency resources of each UE is obtained prior to Proportional Fair (PF) scheduling and is computed based on an exponential moving average in the Uplink (UL) assuming Equal Power Allocation (EPA) among frequency resources. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method is able to efficiently estimate the instantaneous data rate even in a challenging scenario with high co-channel interference such as when Device-to-Device (D2D) communications underlay the cellular network.]]></abstract>

We use an exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA) filter to predict the energy harvested in a complete duty-cycle, and adjust the duty-cycle according to the energy required during the active periods. As a case study, we consider the use of the Frame Slotted-ALOHA (FSA) Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol in a data collection application where a central coordinator interrogates a group of end-devices equipped with solar panels. We evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism by means of computer-based simulations and show that an optimal configuration of the prediction filter can help to reach the ENO condition and ensure the unlimited lifetime of the network.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper we consider a comparative analysis of different deployment solutions in terms of total cost of ownership (TCO) and impact of energy efficiency as a cost parameter, i.e. mobile operator's electric bill. Different deployment options for the wireless segment of the network are considered: macro only versus heterogeneous networks with femto cells to support indoor traffic demand. In addition to the wireless segment different technologies for the backhauling segment are also considered: microwave versus fiber (10G-PON). Considering different user traffic intensities in an urban area and different environments such as business and residential areas, the impact of energy consumption on the TCO has been analyzed. The scope of the paper is extended to compare different backhaul technologies considering the annual increase in the traffic demand up to year 2020. The obtained results indicate that the impact of electric bill becomes more significant over the TCO especially after year 2018. Moreover, the heterogeneous deployment strategy utilizing indoor femto-cells achieves significant savings in terms of electric bill and TCO compared to the macro only solution. However, the saving ratio varies according to the adopted backhauling technology.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, analytical assessment of overlayinband device-to-device (D2D) communications is investigated, under cellular-network-assisted (coordinated) scheduling. To this end, a simple scheduling scheme is assumed that takes into account only local (per cell) topological information of the D2D links. Stochastic geometry tools are utilized in order to obtain analytical expressions for the interferers density as well as the D2D link signal-to-interference-ratio distribution. The analytical results accuracy is validated by comparison with simulations. In addition, the analytical expressions are employed for efficiently optimizing the parameters of a cellular system with overlay D2D communications. It is shown that coordinated scheduling of D2D transmissions enhances system performance both in terms of average user rate as well as maximum allowable D2D link distance.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In order to help operators control the everincreasing mobile data volumes over their cellular networks, many offloading approaches have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present the two main solutions used to alleviate traffic load on the Radio Access Network (RAN), namely femtocells and wifi networks. We show that when using wifi as an offloading solutions, three degrees of integration can be distinguished. In this case, one operator concern is to provide session continuity to mobile users during vertical handover. Hence, several solutions are proposed to overcome this issue.]]></abstract>

This paper tackles the problem of ICIC in the downlink of cellular OFDMA systems where the resource selection process is apprehended as a load balancing game.

<abstract><![CDATA[IEEE 802.11ah Task Group is currently working on the standardization of a new amendment with the focus placed on sensor and actuator networks. It will operate at sub-1GHz bands, ensure transmission ranges up to 1 Km, minimum network data rate of 100 kbps and very low power operation. This new amendment will extend IEEE 802.11 potential to applications such as smart metering, plan automation, eHealth or surveillance. In this paper we propose a novel channel access protocol for IEEE 802.11ah WLANs based on a smart use of the Channel Access Slots (CASs), in which the Restricted Access Windows (RAWs) can be divided. More concretely, our protocol optimizes the number of CASs, their length and their allocation to the stations (STAs). The presented scheme allows both the Access Point (AP) and the STAs to properly deliver data packets in densely populated scenarios, while maximizing the time they remain in sleep mode in order to keep the energy consumption low.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We analyze the ergodic secrecy rate of multi-cell downlink systems assuming that the number of base station (BS) antennas per cell, the number of mobile users, and the number of eavesdropper antennas are all growing without bound. Our analysis includes the effect of uplink channel estimation, pilot contamination, and path-loss. The BS employs zero-forcing (ZF) precoding and artificial noise (AN) generation for secrecy enhancement. Our analytical results reveal that in a secure massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system employing AN, ZF precoding outperforms matched-filter (MF) precoding, unless the signal power is very small, inter-cell interference is severe, or the effect of pilot contamination is dominant.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[There are new challenges to face by network operators and service providers in the wake of convergent fixed and mobile networks. The new, complex traffic scenarios lead to various kinds of performance issues. Before the deployment of new, feature-rich nodes, the performance capabilities of the overall architecture should be verified in many ways. Node and link capacities must be planned - and as part of this: modeled - for mass usage, taking various traffic mix and mobility scenarios into account. This paper introduces a complex traffic modeling methodology. In order to allow complex traffic modeling of various use cases, the methodology features specific variables of the control plane (mainly session- and mobility-related) and the user plane (mainly traffic mix composition-related) of Fixed and Mobile Convergence (FMC) networks. Flexible tools for network planning and performance management should feature the variables introduced in this paper, in order to allow complex handling of FMC use cases.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Emerging interactive satellite applications demand highly efficient transmission schemes. Narrow-band satellite return channels for mobile users have peculiar characteristics that make the optimal user-rate determination a hard problem. Carrier rate enhancement can only be enabled by increasing the user bandwidth and by the application of highly efficient coding schemes. However, with the system bandwidth held constant, gains from increased user bandwidth can be offset by interference from an adjacent user channels. Additional interference is caused by spurious emissions from adjacent channels; these arise from the spectral regrowth caused by the user terminal power amplifier when operated in high-efficiency region. On the other hand, efficient amplification is mandatory to achieve the required signal to noise ratio at the receiver. In this work we propose a combination of transmitter and receiver techniques to improve the user-rate while controlling the user power efficiency.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In many real-world wireless communication systems, the cooperative technique is used as an efficient tool to improve the reliability of the networks. The main advantage of this technique is to achieve the spatial diversity gain through forming virtual antenna arrays. In this paper, we consider the classical three-node Gaussian relay channel by using the decodeand-forward strategy. Assuming perfect receiver channel state information, we propose a near maximum likelihood decoding algorithm at the destination side, based on the trellis structure of the underlying convolutionally coded data. Particularly, our algorithm makes the least approximation to the optimal maximum likelihood decoder, and can be computed efficiently. It is empirically demonstrated that our algorithm can offer significant performance improvement over the conventional decoding algorithms. To this end, our results can indicate an important performance benchmark for this channel model.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this work, we extend and adapt the binary consensus algorithm to operate using clusters in a wireless sensor network. Binary consensus is a decision making algorithm used to cause distributed entities to agree on the majority opinion held by the group when posed with a true or false question. Clustering is a common technique used in WSNs to increase the overall lifetime of the network by reducing energy consumed due to communication. Our clustered binary consensus implementation is tested using a large WSN testbed, and the experimental results show that incorporating clustering into the binary consensus algorithm reduces the time required for motes to reach consensus and lowers the number of packets sent in the network by approximately 94%.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Different transceiver processing methods are considered for filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) multiple access MIMO system. FBMC is considered a contender as an access method for 5G due to better spectral properties without the loss of data rate incurred by the presence of cyclic prefix in comparison to OFDM. Flexible spectrum utilization and possibility of using different pulse shapes for a variety of scenarios make it an attractive option. However, the main challenge in FBMC systems is the presence of intersymbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier inteference (ICI). This makes the receiver performance to be degraded without suitable methods to mitigate those effects especially in the case of MIMO systems where there is a significant need for further investigation. We consider synchronous uplink and downlink multiple access with different processing techniques to alleviate interference. Results show that for the uplink we need to employ forward error correction in addition to receiver processing to obtain acceptable performance levels. With channel state and all users information available, the downlink produces better bit error rates (BER) comparatively.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The concept of cognitive radios has been emerged as a promising solution to the problem of inefficient spectrum utilization in wireless communication networks. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic mechanism for the process of spectrum trading among a primary user and multiple secondary users. More particularly, it is considered an overlay cognitive radio network in which the primary user sells a portion of his licensed spectral resources to the secondary users so as to optimize his utility function. Based on the charging price and the available bandwidth, the secondary users participate in a non-cooperative game with coupled constraints in order to reach an equilibrium bandwidth allocation. Both primary and secondary users have specific BER constraints and employ adaptive coding and modulation. To simplify the computation of the Nash equilibrium of the specific game, we employ the Nikaido-Isoda function and a relaxation algorithm. The simulation results confirm that the proposed mechanism leads to an efficient allocation both for the primary and the secondary users.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[A crucial factor in obtaining accurate efficiency characterization by way of the Wheeler cap is the post-processing method (PPM) that is employed to extract efficiency values from raw measured data. The complementary Q-factor method (CQFM) is the fastest amongst the six PPMs that are currently available. CQFM is an end-to-end methodology for broadband efficiency measurements, which exploits inherently wideband Q-calculation formulas that are based on frequency derivatives of antenna input impedance and on the concept of matched VSWR bandwidth. CQFM is useful both for narrow- and wide-band antennas, regardless of whether the latter exhibit closely or widely spaced multiple (anti-)resonances. Experimental data indicated that the CQFM systematically over-estimates the radiation efficiency of the antenna-under-test (AUT). Two possible reasons theoretically exist: high losses in the materials, and inaccurate calculation of the AUT Q-factor inside the Wheeler cavity. This paper proves that even a mild distortion of the near field of the AUT by the cavity produces an artificially larger capped Q-factor.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose a data cell outage detection scheme for heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with separated control and data plane. We consider a HetNet where the Control Network Layer (CNL) provides ubiquitous network access while Data Network Layer (DNL) provides high data rate transmission to low mobility User Terminals (UTs). Furthermore, network functionalities such as paging and system information broadcast are provided by the CNL to all active UTs, hence, the CNL is aware of all active UTs association. Based on this observation, we categorize our data cell outage detection scheme into the trigger phase and detection phase. In the former, the CNL monitors all UT-data base station association and triggers detection when irregularities occurs in the association, while the later utilizes a grey prediction model on the UT's reference signal received power (RSRP) statistics to determine the existence of an outage. The simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can detect the data cell outage problem in a reliable manner.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In order to solve the resource allocation problem for the interference channel in a cognitive context, we evaluate the application of the superposition coding strategy at the secondary system for underlay multi-carrier cooperative cognitive radio. The objective is to maximize the sum rate of both primary and secondary systems, considering the interference threshold constraint and that the primary receiver always treats interfer- ence as noise. The decoding method at the secondary receiver is either Successive Interference Cancellation, treating interference as noise or Superposition Coding strategy, depending on the channel gains. The proposed algorithm achieves high data rate improvement for the secondary system, and a small improvement for the sum rate of the entire system while causing a very low degradation on the primary system's rate.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, performance of suboptimal receivers for detection of weak M-ary chirp spread spectrum (MCSS) signals in non-Gaussian noise is considered. It is known that optimal receivers for detection weak signals in non-Gaussian consists of zero-memory nonlinearity (ZMNL) followed by the Gaussian correlator receiver. In order to implement the ZMNL, precise a priori knowledge of the first order probability density of the noise is required. However, in practice, it is difficult to know a priori the density of noise precisely. Therefore, it is important to study how an optimal receiver designed for an assumed or estimated noise density will perform when the actual noise density differs from that of the assumed one. In addition, it is useful to consider receivers with various nonlinearities, such as hard limiter, clipper, and hole puncher, that are easy to implement. In this paper, receivers with these suboptimal nonlinearities are analyzed and their symbol error rate (SER) estimates are obtained. The results are shown using the widely used epsilon-mixture noise model.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[A Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is a novel mobile network architecture that has the potential to support extremely dense mobile network deployments enhancing the network capacity while offering cost savings on baseband resources. In this work we analyze cell traffic profiles and evaluate the conditions that impact the statistical multiplexing gain in the Baseband Unit (BBU) Pool. We conclude on the set of parameters that maximize the statistical multiplexing gain, leading to the highest potential cost savings. We then propose a packet based architecture that can adapt to changing traffic conditions. Furthermore, based on theoretical calculations and network simulations we present considerations on deployment scenarios to optimize green field deployments in terms of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). This involves optimizing the mix of cells with different traffic profiles and the BBU Pool positioning in order to reduce the number of required BBUs as well as the required fiber.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper proposes a method to perform simultaneous broadband beamforming and null-steering based on fractional delay filters. An analytical approach in the time domain is studied to obtain an instantaneous response for a fixed beamformer with very low complexity. The simulation of the beamformer in a broadband OFDM system shows the effectiveness of this method to improve the effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio. The process gain obtained by beam-steering improves the effective signal-to-noise-ratio reducing the BER, while the null-steering capacity guarantees the performance of the receiver even in scenarios with strong interferences.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, we present a unified performance analysis of wireless communication over fading channels in terms of the Average Symbol Error Rates (ASER), Average Channel Capacity (ACC) and Moment Generating Function (MGF). We derive simple and accurate exact and approximate closed-form expressions for ASER, encapsulating all types of coherent digital modulation, as well as exact expressions for the ACC and MGF, for the alpha - eta - mu and alpha -kappa - mu generalized fading distributions, which accurately characterize, thanks to their remarkable flexibility, the nonlinearity, and at the same time the non-homogeneous nature of the propagation medium, including the alpha - mu (generalized Gamma), the eta - mu, the kappa - mu, the Weibull, the Nakagami-q (Hoyt), the Nakagami-n (Rice), the Nakagami-m, the Rayleigh, the Lognormal, the Gamma, the Exponential, and the One-sided Gaussian fading distributions as special cases. The derived expressions are analytically-traceable and convenient to use both numerically and analytically, allowing simple unconstrained analysis, accurate system planning and performance evaluation. Monte Carlo simulations and existing solutions for the special cases of these fading distributions have been used to validate the derived expressions, where an excellent match is achieved.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Applying OFDM/OQAM system to multiple antennas systems is expected to be a very efficient system because optimally exploiting both bandwidth and spatial diversity. Nevertheless, combining these two techniques ineluctably leads to a system with low freedom degrees at the transmitter side, in terms of number on antenna for example or to receivers with high complexity in order to deal with generated interferences.This article proposes to use Time Reversal as precoding of a OFDM/OQAM system irrespective of the number of transmit antennas in a MISO system. As already demonstrated for MISO OFDM system, the equivalent channel coefficients are proven to be purely real, and thus received signals can more efficiently and coherently added at the receiver side. In fact, this ??equivalent channel?? allows, under some assumptions, to totally suppress the residual interference. Bit Error Rate simulation results are finally provided showing the efficiency of the global system.The computational simplicity and the results also indicates that the proposed system is well suited for large MISO systems.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Interference is one of the major performance limiting factors in MIMO-based cellular systems. A promising interference coordination strategy being studied in 4G LTEAdvanced systems and beyond is Network MIMO. In systems based on Network MIMO, base stations (BSs) are pooled together to form a multi-cell virtual MIMO system and signal processing is done in a coordinated manner. Although the processing capability of BSs and backhaul capacity are improving, performing network MIMO on a global scale is highly complex and unscalable because of the amount of data exchange required. In this paper, a scalable interference coordination strategy of combining clustered network MIMO with fractional frequency reuse (FFR) is proposed for the downlink of a homogeneous LTE-Advanced system. The cell sum rate performance of this new strategy is shown to be comparable to that of global coordination and also significantly better than two existing approaches in the literature.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We analyze information delivery over a network where direct data exchange via wireless is not possible and therefore intermittent connection through vehicular relaying is used. We refer to a multi-hop scenario where a stationary unit exchanges data packets with a destination outside its communication range, using passing-by vehicles as information carriers. In such a context, we propose an exact mathematical model based on Markov chains to quantify relevant performance metrics. In particular, while throughput-related parameters can be directly obtained via queueing analysis, delay statistics are more complex to derive, due to the in-order delivery requirement for the transmitted information content. Hence, data packets transported by fast vehicles still need to wait for the reception of all previous packets, possibly carried by slower vehicles. Nevertheless, by properly exploiting structural properties of the resulting Markov chains, the delay statistics can be fully characterized.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Enhanced interference coordination mechanisms have been proposed to overcome the inter cell interference problem in co-channel Heterogeneous Cellular Networks (Het-Nets). However, these mechanisms compromise the macro layer resources and put high requirements on backhaul. Here we propose a new approach for the interference management in HetNets which requires neither coordination nor does it compromise the resource utilization in macro layer. It is simply based on the transmit precoding design, using Multi User Inter Cell Interference Alignment (MUICIA). The idea is to align the multi user interference subspace with the partial inter cell interference subspace and suppress it at the desired receiver. We show that MUICIA achieves higher mean cell rates than the state of the art transmit precoding schemes in HetNets. Moreover, we compare the performance of MUICIA with time domain interference coordination technique and show that MUICIA provides higher spectral efficiency as well as fair resource utilization.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper considers the design of a transceiver able to provide a data rate of 10Gbps for the backhaul of the future mobile network. The paper describes a zero-IF architecture to support 64-QAM and a bandwidth of 2GHz in E-Band. Zero-IF architectures present several impairments that corrupt the information bearing base-band signal around DC. The paper reviews these issues paying special attention to the AC couplings in the transceiver analog chain. This RF impairment is modelled at system level and its impact on transceiver performance is evaluated. The results presented in the paper highlight the importance of this RF impairment for high-order modulation. It is shown that the destruction of more than 0.01% of the signal in 64-QAM can yield an important loss in performance.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Channel bonding is one of the strategies considered in the IEEE 802.11ac amendment to improve the performance of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). However, besides the obvious gains attainable from using wider channels in terms of higher achievable transmission rates, there are also several potential drawbacks that may seriously compromise the overall WLAN performance, most notably the higher probability to suffer from external interference. The goal of this paper is to assess the suitability of channel bonding for enhancing the performance of short-range WLANs, which are highly susceptible to external interference. We analytically model and evaluate the performance of the two channel access schemes proposed for the IEEE 802.11ac amendment that enable the use of channel bonding. The results show that for short-range WLANs, the use of channel bonding is able to provide a significant performance boost when the presence of external interference is low to moderate, specially if the dynamic bandwidth channel access scheme is enabled.]]></abstract>

The smoothing filter consists of forward and backward recursive filters, each of which is analogous to a conventional first-order phase-locked loop. Results of the mean square error performance are shown for this smoothing filter-based phase error estimation method when working in data-aided and decision-directed modes. We then apply the method as a code-aided phase error estimation technique in an iterative receiver framework. It is shown through simulations that the scheme has a very high phase noise tolerance.]]></abstract>

The objective is to design online strategies that minimize the competitive rate gap that is defined as the maximum gap between the optimal rates that can be achieved by the offline and online policies over all possible energy arrival profiles. It is shown that the competitive rate gap is upper-bounded by the logarithm of the number of slots, and a myopic online transmission policy is proposed that achieves a lower rate gap.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Device-to-device (D2D) communication has been shown to increase the spectrum and energy efficiency of local communication sessions in cellular networks. On the other hand, physical layer network coding (NWC) at a cellular base station ?? which can be employed without D2D functionality ?? can also improve the efficiency of a cellular network that carries local traffic. In this paper we study the joint application of D2D and NWC technologies with the purpose of further improving the performance of cellular networks that employ either D2D or NWC alone. We find that the joint D2D and NWC scheme yields additional gains, provided that the network exercises proper mode selection (MS) and resource allocation. Specifically, a cellular network that supports both D2D and NWC can achieve higher spectral and energy efficiency than a network that employs only one of these schemes.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We consider a single cell single input multiple output (SIMO) system employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In such systems, setting the pilot-to-data power ratio (PDPR) has a large impact on the spectral and energy efficiency. In this paper we provide a closed form solution for the mean square error (MSE) of the received data as a function of the PDPR assuming Gaussian channels and minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalization. In numerical experiments we find that the MSE is a convex function of the PDPR and study the PDPR that minimizes the MSE as the number of antennas at the base station (BS) grows large. We find that the MSE-minimizing PDPR heavily depends on the number of antennas and the path loss between the mobile station and the BS. Specifically, as the number of antennas grows large, a larger portion of the total power budget needs to be allocated for pilot signals, especially for low path loss users.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Tethered interference cancelation is an important operation in a multitude of scenarios, both commercial (named ??full-duplex?? operation) as well as military (interference excision). The fundamental assumption behind active or tethered cancellation is that a copy of the interference is available in realtime, and its removal therefore is somehow possible. We discuss the basic concepts of and issues related to active cancellation, present relevant architectures, and conclude with comparisons between the two types of applications.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Efficient energy management is an essential requirement in the design of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). These networks are composed of sensor nodes, which may rely on batteries of limited energy capacity. In addition, many wireless sensor networks are deployed in environments, which are hard to access in order to replace or recharge these batteries. Therefore, maximizing lifetime of such networks is of a paramount importance. A considerable previous research addressed this issue from different angles. One of which is by proposing intelligent models that aim to reduce the number of selected sensors that report environmental measurements. Hence, achieve high energy-efficiency while maintaining a desired level of accuracy in predicting the reported measurement and decision outcomes. The main contribution of this paper is proposing an intelligent model for efficient energy management in WSNs by using the Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) neural network as a classification algorithm. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, several wireless sensor network simulation scenarios based on Ionosphere, Forest CoverType and Sensor Discrimination datasets were conducted. Results show a significant improvement in accuracy level of MLP's prediction compared to Naive Bayes.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Developing Self Organizing Network (SON) algorithms for enhanced Inter Cell Interference Co-ordination (eICIC) and investigating their co-existence with other SON features such as Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO) requires studying how much the performance of users is affected in terms of e.g. throughput and Radio Link Failures (RLFs). However, for such a study, computationally-efficient and abstract radio resource management models are indispensable. This work contributes a simplified and fast scheduler model based on utility maximization. The simplified model is compared with scheduler model that is built with numerical method. With the help of simulations, it is shown that the simplified scheduler model exhibits a similar resource sharing behavior and UE throughput statistics as the numerical one.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Centralized Self-Optimization techniques has been gaining interest in the telecommunications community to automate the manual optimization process thereby bringing CAPital EXpenditure (CAPEX) and OPerational EXpenditure (OPEX) gains to the operator. We have developed in our previous work, a novel iterative self-optimization methodology based on surrogate functions to model functional relationships between the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and network (configuration) parameters. These relationships are then used by an optimization engine to compute the optimized network parameters which are injected back into the network and the process continues iteratively. In this paper, we use the proposed methodology to solve self-optimization objectives in LTE-A Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) for two scenarios: enhanced InterCell Interference Coordination (eICIC) and Active Antenna Systems (AAS) based optimization. Results obtained using a network simulator provides a comparison of the two scenarios with relative advantages and disadvantages in a centralized self organizing context.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In a distributed system most nodes maintain a local oscillator to derive time information for synchronization with other nodes. A number of clock synchronization techniques have been presented in the literature (e.g. NTP, PTP) which rely on the exchange of messages among nodes to share timing information and to adjust the offset or skew of the clocks. In this paper we present an approach which does not require any adjustments to the local clocks, but relies on achieving synchronization through clock mapping functions which map the time at one node to the time at another node. We further show how closed paths in a graph of nodes can be used to estimate the synchronization tolerance. Through experimental results using piecewise linear functions, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and show how clock synchronization of better than 100 ps can be achieved in Wi-Fi environments.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[A point-to-point communication system in which the transmitter is equipped with an energy harvesting (EH) device and a rechargeable battery of limited size is considered. The harvested energy profile is assumed to be known in advance, that is, the problem is studied in the offline optimization framework. A practical communication system is considered, in which the possible transmission rates, and equivalently, power levels, belong to a finite set of discrete values. This problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem, which can be solved numerically. In order to provide further insights into the nature of the optimal transmission policy, an alternative solution is provided based on the solution of the continuous version of this problem, which itself has a ??shortest path?? interpretation. We propose an optimal algorithm, which permits us to easily build the solution of the discrete case from the continuous case, using an equivalence notion between different transmission policies, and several equivalence- preserving transformations.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Coordinating base stations (BSs) in current and future mobile access networks is an important approach to reduce interference and to achieve high data rates. One coordination approach is Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) transmission, in which a set of multiple BSs transmit data to a user equipment (UE) in a coordinated manner. Among the BSs CoMP requires high capacities and low latencies in the backhaul network connecting the BSs. We have developed an optimization problem and a heuristic algorithm that verify the feasibility of BSs coordination in a backhaul network with limited capacity. In addition to that, our approach also assigns backhaul network resources (i.e. wavelengths in an optical WDM backhaul) proportional to the actual requirements. We call this backhaul network configuration. Our evaluations show that the heuristic algorithm performs close to the optimal solution, while reducing the execution time by about four orders of magnitude. We also show how our approach can be used to operate the backhaul network in a trafficproportional way to reduce the overall energy consumption of the backhaul network.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Effective spectrum sensing strategies enable cognitive radios to enhance the spectrum efficiency. In this paper, modeling, performance analysis, and optimization of spectrum handoff in a centralized cognitive radio network are studied. More specifically, for a given sensing order, the average throughput of secondary users and average interference level among the secondary and primary users are evaluated for a cognitive radio network with only one secondary user. By a Markov chain analysis, a network with multiple secondary users performing cooperative spectrum sensing is modeled, and the above performance metrics are derived. Then, a maximization of the secondary network performance in terms of throughput while keeping under control the average interference is formulated. Finally, numerical results validate the analytical derivations and show that optimally tuning sensing time significantly enhances the performance of the spectrum handoff. Also, we observe that exploiting OR rule for cooperative spectrum sensing provides a higher average throughput compared to AND rule.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Minimizing the cost of a cellular network usually includes the optimum selection and location of base-stations, that meet certain coverage and capacity constraints. In the framework of LTE wireless networks, coverage and capacity planning are interrelated in terms of interference. Moreover, the ever increasing capacity demand for non-uniformly distributed users, along with mixed cell scenarios and relay nodes, makes base station location optimization a non trivial task. To address this issue we propose a genetic algorithm based methodology that optimally performs the task of base-stations location by minimizing the cost of the network while fulfilling the coverage and capacity criteria. Example results are provided for case study scenarios that give useful planning insights for LTE systems.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Asymmetric modulation schemes are candidates for conveying quality feedback in the form of multi-level ACK/NACK in a system employing reliability-based HARQ. Asymmetric QPSK (A-QPSK) modulation, for example, enables to convey one ACK level and three NACK levels with unequal error protection of the ACK and NACK levels, each NACK level representing a certain quality level of a received packet. In this work, the performance of A-QPSK modulation for conveying multi-level ACK/NACK is assessed by deriving approximations of the error rates for AWGN channel and by means of link level simulations for LTE uplink. It was found that use of AQPSK modulation for conveying multi-level ACK/NACK provides valuable transmit power savings over the conventional symmetric QPSK modulation, with gains of about 0.6 - 0.8dB for users at cell edge and about 1.6 - 1.9dB for users with moderate channel conditions. This translates into extra power requirements over BPSK-modulated binary ACK/NACK of about 2.3 - 2.5dB and 1.6 - 1.8dB, respectively.]]></abstract>

Many questions related to the estimation and detection of the useful signal arise. Because of their particular structure, these issues are in connection to the problem that the mathematics community refers to as ??spike detection and estimation??. Previous works in this direction have been restricted to either determining the number of spikes or estimating their values while knowing their multiplicities. This motivates our work which considers the joint estimation of the number of spikes and their corresponding orders, a problem which has not been yet investigated to the best of our knowledge.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The intermediate network nodes (relays) in Wireless (Physical Layer) Network Coding (WNC) systems are allowed to process only some specific (??hierarchical") functions of user data (instead of separate decoding of individual user signals), which allows to overcome the rate limits induced by the conventional Multiple Access Channels capacity regions. Unfortunately, since the mapping between a specific decoded hierarchical function and the corresponding signal space representation is generally one-to-many, traditional successive decoding techniques with perfect interference cancellation (subtraction) of decoded signals cannot be directly employed in WNC systems. In this paper we show that even in this case the knowledge of hierarchical data can be efficiently exploited in the decoding process to significantly reduce the impact of interfering signal on the subsequent decoding operations in WNC systems.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[One of the main drivers for new waveforms in future 5G wireless communication systems is to handle efficiently the variety of traffic types and requirements. In this paper, we introduce a new random access within the standard acquisition procedures to support sporadic traffic as an enabler of the Internet of Things (IoT). The major challenge hereby is to cope with the highly asynchronous access of different devices and to allow transmission of control signaling and payload ??in one shot??. We address this challenge by using a waveform design approach based on bi-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. We show that this approach allows data transmission in frequencies that otherwise have to remain unused. More precisely, we utilize frequencies previously used as guard bands, located towards the standard synchronous communication pipes as well as in between the typically small amount of resources used by each IoT device. We demonstrate the superiority of this waveform approach over the conventional random access using numerical experiments.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We consider a single-link wireless communication system where the transmitter has a finite-capacity rechargeable battery that is receiving energy packets from an energy harvesting device (EHD) at certain time instants. A random energy leakage is assumed during the energy transfer from the EHD to the battery. For cases where the energy leakage can be described by statistical distribution models, we formulate the parametric average throughput maximization problem (P) with probabilistic energy and battery capacity constraints. We develop parameter dependent stochastic transmission policies (STPs) to manage the transmission power over a finite transmission interval. It is shown that STP improves the average throughput over both the static additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels by shortening the silent intervals, which occur when leakage unaware power allocation techniques are applied.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In multimode transceivers, the transmitter for one communication standard induces a strong local interference in the receiver for another standard. Such strong interference can severely affect the receiver, if it is not suppressed at an early stage of the receiver. A widely explored method to cancel a locally induced interference is to construct its replica, using an analogue model of the interference coupling path, and subtract it from the received signal. Performance of the cancellation method mainly depends on the model accuracy which is limited by the affordable complexity. This paper performs a feasibility study on the application of the cancellation in multimode transceivers based on a simulated scenario. In contrast to previous works, the presented analysis allows an easy comparison between variations of the cancellation method with different complexities. It is found that with a practical complexity the model is not sufficiently accurate. Thus only cancellation in a narrow band is attained. Moreover, the coupling of the local transmitter noise to the local receiver increases. A more accurate model can improve the cancellation; however, it is overly complex for mobile devices. This suggests the requirement for alternative methods to successfully mitigate the local interference.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper deals with the orthogonal design of a cyclic block filtered multitone modulation (CB-FMT) system. CB-FMT is a filter bank modulation scheme that uses well frequency localized pulses as in FMT but the linear convolutions are replaced by circular convolutions. We derive the orthogonality conditions both in the time domain and in the frequency domain. Then, we show that such conditions can be fulfilled with a hyper-spherical parameterization of the pulse frequency components. Finally, optimal frequency localized orthogonal pulses are searched. It is shown that much higher in-band-to-out-of-band sub-channel energy is achieved for both critically sampled and non-critically sampled architectures compared to baseline solutions corresponding to either the use of a rectangular or a root-raised-cosine window in frequency. Finally, a comparison with OFDM shows that higher spectral efficiency can be provided by orthogonal CB-FMT.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[A novel analytical framework is presented to evaluate resource consumption, error ratio, and spectral efficiency on PHY, MAC and RLC layer in relay enhanced 3GPP LTE systems. Thereby, various aspects of the various LTE protocol layers are modeled: On PHY layer, association of user terminal to a radio access point, probabilistic radio channel states, adaptive modulation and coding, overhead in LTE radio frame, turbo coded M-QAM block error rate, and Chase combining are taken into account. On MAC layer, hybrid-ARQ protocol, resource assignment failure, and feedback misdetection are accounted for. On RLC layer, segmentation of a RLC SDU into several RLC PDUs, selective repeat - ARQ protocol, feedback loss, and timer for upcoming feedback to be waited for are considered. Aspect of two hop transmission is modeled and analyzed for decode and forward relaying. The framework is useful to evaluate various performance parameters for relay enhanced cells and for picocell enhanced donor cells as well: Resource consumption, error ratio and spectral efficiency are calculated as CDFs for any location in a multi-cell scenario, as location specific expected values, as CDFs for a cell, and as related expected values and percentiles.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Traffic carried over wireless networks has grown significantly in recent years and actual forecasts show that this trend is expected to continue. However, the rapid mobile data explosion and the need for higher data rates comes at a cost of increased complexity and energy consumption of the mobile networks. Although base station equipment is improving its energy efficiency by means of new power amplifiers and increased processing power, additional techniques are required to further reduce the energy consumption. In this paper, we evaluate different energy saving techniques and study their impact on the energy consumption based on a nation-wide network of a leading European operator. By means of an extensive analysis, we show that with the proposed techniques significant energy savings can be realized.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The Interfering Broadcast Channel (IBC) applies to the downlink of cellular and heterogenous networks, which are limited by multi-user interference. The interference alignment (IA) concept has shown that interference does not need to be inevitable. In particular spatial IA in MIMO IBC allows for low latency and requires little diversity. However, IA requires perfect and typically global Channel State Information at the Transmitter(s) (CSIT), whose acquisition does not scale with network size. Hence, designs that are optimal in terms of Degrees of Freedom (DoF) may not be so in terms of the more relevant net DoF, accounting for CSI acquistion. Also, the design of transmitters (Txs) and receivers (Rxs) is coupled and hence needs to be centralized or duplicated. Recently, a number of (usually suboptimal in terms of DoF) approaches with reduced, incomplete or local CSIT requirements have been introduced requiring less CSI acquisition overhead and allowing decoupled Tx/Rx designs. This network decomposition is aided by the for finite SNR more relevant topological IBC scenario. We shall discuss CSI acquisition and Tx/Rx design for topological IBCs and interfering HetNets (macro/small cell hierarchical IBCs). At finite SNR, essentially reduced rank MIMO channels may appear also and the transition to Massive MIMO furthermore introduces a reduced rank in the covariance CSIT, all allowing further network decomposition.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Multibeam satellite systems have been recently studied in order to provide broadband services to their coverage area by employing fractional frequency reuse pattern. Towards a more spectrally efficient system, the designer can resort to full frequency reuse among beams with on-ground extra signal processing as a precoding or detecting scheme for limiting the interbeam interference. These techniques have shown great potential in the multibeam system architecture. However, feeding all these data from a single gateway is not feasible based on the current frequency bandwidth resources utilized on the feeder link. In this paper, the focus is set on the forward link of a multibeam satellite system where full frequency reuse among beams with linear precoding technique is considered. In this context, we investigate a multiple gateway scenario where each gateway is serving a cluster of adjacent beams. Note that with a multiple gateway architecture, the feeder link spectral resources can be shared by all the gateways since they use directive antennas so that interference is minimized and the spectral efficieny of the feeder link system is increased. We present a novel multiple gateway Zero Forcing (ZF) precoder design which mitigates both the inter and intra-cluster interference. The provided simulation results quantify the performance gain obtained by our method.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Electromagnetic metamaterials are artificially structured materials composed of periodic arrays of -typically resonant-sub-wavelength metallic structures whose electric or magnetic response provides the freedom to design dielectric or magnetic properties that might not exist in conventional materials. By changing the geometrical parameters of the constituent structure of a metamaterial, the realized dielectric or magnetic properties can be engineered. As a result, metamaterials enable the design of materials with choice electromagnetic properties. In this paper, the design and analysis of compact multiband inverted F-L (IFL) patch antenna using 3D metamaterial structure has been introduced and analyzed. The analysis and design are done by a commercial software. The radiation characteristics, such as, return loss, VSWR, input impedance, radiation patterns and the surface current densities have been introduced and discussed. Finally, the proposed optimum antenna design structure has been fabricated and the measured S-parameters of the proposed structure can be analyzed with network analyzer and compared with simulation results to demonstrate the excellent performance and meet the requirements for wireless communication applications.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[To obtain the appropriate number of layers for spatial multiplexing transmission on a high speed train equipped with moving relay nodes (MRN) cooperating with each other, the rank indicator (RI) is required. The conventional methods for calculating the RI have high levels of computational complexity and to dynamically obtain the RI based on the channel conditions require multiple times the computational complexity of a fixed rank transmission. We derive a method to reduce the computational complexity such that the RI is fixed, but the antenna positioning vary dynamically based on the channel conditions. Our simulation results show that our proposed method can achieve nearly the same throughput as with dynamic rank transmission schemes on the backhaul link with reduced complexity.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Most of today's advanced cellular network models consider time-stationary behavior neglecting that networks are frequently subjected to transient effects due to, e.g., fluctuating traffic demand. In addition, modern concepts such as small cells and heterogeneous networks might introduce short-term dynamics that have to be taken into account as well. For instance, microcells can be switched on and off dynamically in order to adapt the energy consumption and frequency usage to varying input loads. Supplementary to existing steady-state flow level models, we present techniques enabling a transient analysis of system startup and non-stationary traffic scenarios. In detail, we propose analytical and numerical techniques based on queueing theory and differential equations to model the transient behavior of interference-coupled cellular networks exactly, and suggest further approximations for the same. Numerical studies reveal the need for transient models and show that the approximation techniques offer a reasonable trade-off between accuracy and fast computation.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We study slotted Aloha with multiple base stations, where m base stations cooperate to decode signals from n users. Both users and base stations are placed uniformly at random over an area. Each user transmits its packet replicas at multiple slots and is heard by all base stations in its geographical vicinity. We present cooperative decoding algorithms where base stations can utilize the successive interference cancellation (SIC) mechanism in two ways-spatially and temporally. Spatial SIC allows for the interference cleaning across neighboring base stations: when a base station decodes a user, it sends the users signal to all other stations that cover the user, thus enabling the interference cleaning at the receiving stations. With temporal SIC, each base station cleans the interference locally, across different time slots. Specifically, we present decoding schemes with four different degrees of cooperation, namely: 1) non-cooperative; 2) with spatial SIC only (spatial cooperation); with temporal SIC only (temporal cooperation); and 4) with both spatial and temporal SICs (spatio-temporal cooperation). We present several results on the performance of decoding algorithms. First, with each of the four algorithms, the peak throughput increases linearly in the number of base stations m. Second, simulation examples show that spatio-temporal cooperation yields significant gains over the other two schemes. Finally, we analyze with each of the schemes the threshold on the normalized load-largest load for which the decoding probability equals to its maximal possible value.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper presents a general blind channel estimation algorithm for multicarrier transmission. The first stage is based on the classical Viterbi & Viterbi approach with the estimation of the mean value of the 4th order moments of received samples. The channel frequency response being estimated independently, phase ambiguities between frequencies have then to be fixed. This correction is done considering only an upper bound for the delay spread of the propagation channel. A projection algorithm is then introduced leading to the estimation of the channel impulse response. The proposed algorithm can be applied to all kinds of multicarrier waveforms. It leads to a communication capacity increase and it can also be used efficiently in a cognitive radio network context.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Current multibeam satellite systems consist of a very large number of spot beams. In this paper, we analyze them from the large scale MIMO perspective, and establish a comparison with massive MIMO systems. It will be shown that the large number of beams has important operational implications, and that it simplifies the analysis because it allows using asymptotic results. However, it will also be shown that current multibeam satellite links, despite their large number of antennas, do not qualify as massive MIMO systems.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Mobile video service is one of the most increasing uses expected in future generation cellular networks, including multicast video services. Based upon Evolved Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service (eMBMS) available with 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) release 9, Long Term Evolution (LTE) can provide broadcast/multicast content delivery with a single-frequency network mode. This means sending the same multimedia content to a mass audience within a specific area. However, it is not always possible to use multicast transmission to every user because of their different channel conditions, so unicast transmission should also be used to fulfill Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for multicast services. This paper proposes a Joint Multicast/Unicast Scheduling (JMUS) strategy for multicast service delivery. This method is based on dynamic optimization at each LTE frame, obtaining the optimal Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) for multicast transmission, the optimal number of subframes reserved for multicast transmission and allocating the remaining resources using a unicast scheduling metric for guaranteed data-rate. The goal of the scheduling technique proposed is to maximize the overall throughput, guaranteeing a target bit rate for all the users in the area. A new JMUS with dynamic optimization is presented to improve QoS performance. Finally, a fast search algorithm is evaluated to approach the optimal values for dynamic optimization with an order of magnitude fewer iterations than using exhaustive search.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Device-to-Device (D2D) communications underlying cellular networks appears as a promising solution to increase network capacity and offload the cellular network through a direct link with reduced congestion. However, D2D communications can generate significant interference to the cellular network when the same resources are shared by both systems. Therefore, interference management techniques such as Power Control (PC) are required to keep the interference under control. In this paper, we provide a performance assessment of a PC algorithm with variable target Signal to Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) applied to cellular and D2D communications, which is called Soft Dropping (SD). Simulation results have shown that the SD algorithm applied to D2D communications can improve the system spectral efficiency of cellular communications in 14% and still significantly reduce the power of D2D transmitters in 49% without harm the system spectral efficiency achieved by D2D receivers. Moreover, by allowing a reduction on the performance of D2D communications, the cellular communications can be further improved with additional power saving of D2D transmitters.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We study the optimization of the number of bits allocated by energy harvesting users for sending feedback to a common multiple-antenna access point (AP). The nodes need to distribute their feedback transmissions judiciously across time (and channel states) in order to maximize certain throughput goals. While the MISO channel capacity from the AP to a user is a strictly increasing function of the number of feedback bits sent by the user to the AP for providing channel state information, the energy consumption for sending this feedback is (assumed to be) directly proportional to the number of feedback bits. Considering long term throughput, the nodes need to adapt the number of bits of feedback to their energy harvesting profiles. I]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, we investigate the outage probability of decode-and-forward (DF) relaying system allowing intra-link (source-relay link) errors, where all the links between the source, relay and destination nodes suffer from independent block Rayleigh fading. In the system, we assume, even if errors are detected in the information sequence after decoding, the relay node still re-encodes and forwards the data sequence containing errors to the destination. The theoretical backbone of this system concept is that the data sequences sent form the source and relay nodes are highly correlated with each other because they are transmitted from the same source, and the correlation knowledge can be well exploited by the joint decoding at the destination node. We derive the outage probability expression for this system, based on Shannon's lossy source-channel separation and Slepian-Wolf's correlated source coding theorems. Moreover, with this system assumption, it is found that the optimal position of the relay is the midpoint between the source and destination nodes. Results of the simulations are provided to verify the accuracy of the analytical results.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper addresses the problem of phase-noise estimation and mitigation in full-duplex radio transceivers. It has been shown before that the phase-noise is one of the most critical factors limiting the self-interference suppression performance in full-duplex radio transceivers. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for the phase-noise estimation and mitigation. The algorithm has high estimation quality and low computational complexity, and it does not require synchronization of the useful and self-interference signals, so it is applicable also in long-range communications. The performance of the algorithm is then evaluated and compared to the performance of the state-of-theart algorithm with extensive computer simulations.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper presents unified and accurate performance analysis of multiple dual-hop, non-generative relays in cooperative wireless communication systems over independent and non-identical Nakagami-m fading channels with arbitrary fading parameters. The performance is studied in terms of the average symbol error probability for various coherent modulation schemes. Our proposed moment generating function based analytical framework is also sufficiently general to compress all types of coherent, differentially-coherent and non-coherent digital modulation schemes. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified by simulation and compared to the exact and approximate solutions. The proposed mathematical analysis is complemented by numerical results for average symbol error probability; including the effect of fading severity of the channel, number of acting relays, existence of the direct path between the source and the destination, and transmitted signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the numerical results study the effect of fading parameters and the number of cooperative relays on the performance of the average symbol error probability.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[With proliferation of Cloud technologies, the need for connecting wireless sensor networks to Cloud servers arose. With easy accessibility to the cloud and the increased processing power of cloud servers, it became possible to gather data from sensor networks at different locations and process large amount of sensor data. A new generation WSN gateways is needed for this purpose in order to connect the sensors to cloud servers. In this paper, a design and implementation method for RESTful WSN Gateways is proposed using a Javascript based framework, Node.js, which uses asynchronous programming model and can handle a large amount of network connections simultaneously. The gateway is designed as an Embedded Linux device, which can handle multiple accesses with both sensors and cloud servers. All communication APIs residing inside the gateway is designed to be RESTful, HTTP API for communication with cloud servers and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for sensor communication. The proposed approach in this paper provides seamless integration between cloud applications and sensors with its well-defined standard API and minimizes the development time of WSN gateways.]]></abstract>

To meet such challenge, a revolutionary change in the network architecture is required. In this paper, we discuss potential directions for the future wireless network architecture and key techniques. An edge cloud and underlay network architecture is proposed by leveraging techniques such as network virtualization, edge computing, local traffic offloading, cloudbased control and processing for improving the overall network efficiency and user experience. This technology advance forms the foundation of the next generation wireless network architecture. Case studies on key enabling techniques of the proposed edge cloud and underlay network architecture are presented together with preliminary design concepts and numerical results.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Machine-to-Machine (M2M) area networks connect a gateway with a huge number of energy-constrained end-devices. Therefore, energy efficiency is essential to prolong the lifetime of M2M networks. In this paper, we consider an M2M area network composed of hundreds or thousands of end-devices that periodically transmit data upon request from a gateway. We propose a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol based on Frame Slotted-ALOHA (FSA) with Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), also referred to as SIC-FSA, for data collection applications. By means of comprehensive computer-based simulations, we evaluate the delay and the energy consumed by the gateway and the enddevices using SIC-FSA. We have compared the delay and energy performance provided by SIC-FSA with that of conventional FSA and diversity-FSA (D-FSA). Results show that SIC-FSA can reduce the delay and energy consumption of the gateway in more than 50%, and the energy consumed by an end-device in more than 10%, with respect to FSA in dense M2M networks equipped with radio-transceivers in compliance with the IEEE 802.11 physical layer.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We explore the potential of advantageously utilizing transmit correlation and mutual coupling in large-scale multiple input multiple output (MIMO) transmitters using low complexity closed form precoding techniques. Towards this end, we investigate the effect of increasing the number of antenna elements in a fixed transmitter space. This gives rise to two contradicting phenomena: the reduction of spatial diversity due to reducing the separation between antennas and the increase in transmit diversity by increasing the number of elements. We explore a precoding technique that exploits the increasing transmit correlation and mutual coupling to improve the received signal power. We investigate densely deployed uniform linear antenna arrays modeled in the CST Microwave Studio. The simulations show the somewhat surprising result that, by reducing the separations between the antennas to significantly less than the transmit wavelength to fit more antennas, improved performance is obtained.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[With the proliferation of location based services (LBS), various indoor localization systems have been proposed based on received signal strength (RSS). An acceptable localization performance is achieved by using fingerprinting-based methods. However, its performance is restricted by RSS deviation. This deviation is not well modelled and studied in past. With this motivation, we propose a novel RSS model to define this deviation based on orthogonal frequency dimensional multiplexing (OFDM). Unlike conventional random RSS fluctuation, this deviation cannot be eliminated by merely using sample average. Hence, we also propose a power-bias mitigation algorithm to improve the performance through eliminating part of the deviation. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate good performance gains are achieved by using the power-bias mitigation algorithm under various scenarios.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We derive low complexity versions of a wide range of algorithms for sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) in underdetermined linear systems. The proposed algorithms are obtained by applying the generalized mean field (GMF) inference framework to a generic SBL probabilistic model. In the GMF framework, we constrain the auxiliary function approximating the posterior probability density function of the unknown variables to factorize over disjoint groups of contiguous entries in the sparse vector - the size of these groups dictates the degree of complexity reduction. The original high-complexity algorithms correspond to the particular case when all the entries of the sparse vector are assigned to one single group. Numerical investigations are conducted for both a generic compressive sensing application and for channel estimation in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing receiver. They show that, by choosing small group sizes, the resulting algorithms perform nearly as well as their original counterparts but with much less computational complexity.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Radio network dimensioning is an essential step towards designing a cellular network and has traditionally relied on a pragmatic approach to capture the effects of fading and shadowing on the system interference. However, with the increased flexibility of LTE which builds on the statistical variation of wireless channels by adapting resources accordingly, there is a need for new customized dynamic dimensioning methods. The main contribution in this paper is a statistical approach to link budget analysis for LTE that jointly accounts for fading and shadowing in the channel as well as loading due to traffic demand in the interference calculation. Derivations of probability density functions (PDF) of three dimensioning parameters: interference margin, maximum allowed path loss and cell range are first presented. The PDF's are then validated and used in different scenarios to capture the tradeoff trends between coverage, capacity and quality of service constraints in LTE. Finally, cellular network dimensioning insights and guidelines are discussed based on the obtained results.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system uses the principle of radiative power transfer between the reader and the tag antenna. The main performance metric for RFID system is the reliable reading coverage, where the tag can be read with higher detection probability. Most of current researches consider the reader coverage to be determined only by its read range assuming monostatic configuration with omni-directional antennas. In this paper, we model and study the effect of cascaded channel fading and readers antenna orientation on the passive RFID tags, in terms of detection probability. We derive a closed-form expression for passive RFID detection probability taking into consideration the relative reader-tag antennas orientations and cascaded Rician-forward/Rayleigh-reverse fading channel. The derived formulas can be useful for design and optimization of passive RFID communication systems from RF point of view.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper considers the effectiveness of low power lamppost mounted 3G/WCDMA microcells to capture traffic when deployed on a common carrier frequency with an overlaying 3G/WCDMA macrocell layer. The paper assesses the potential offload achieved through the deployment of thirteen low power (+24dBm maximum output power) lamppost mounted 3G/WCDMA microcells along a busy street in central London through both simulation and field trials. The paper concludes that low power +24dBm 3G/WCDMA microcells have the potential to significantly offload a co-channel macrocell layer, provided that the microcells are placed in areas of high traffic and are spaced close enough together (<100m) to provide contiguous microcell dominance.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The upcoming device-to-device (D2D) communication paradigm will be game-changing for content distribution among wireless users. In this work we ask the following question: Assuming that mobile device owners are connected with social ties in a social network graph and that such information can be extracted by a wireless operator, how can the operator leverage the social network ties for efficient data transport? We consider a set of content sessions, each with a source and a destination. For each session, the operator needs to find the path from source to destination that minimizes total communication cost. The communication cost between each pair of nodes is the transmission delay (time delay per transmitted bit) between nodes, thus reflecting bandwidth consumption for the operator per unit of transmitted bit. The D2D forwarding paradigm grants the freedom to each node across to the path to accept the incoming traffic and forward it further or not. We model the probability that a node accepts incoming traffic as a function of its social ties with other nodes and we require that the solution results in a minimum probability of content delivery to destination. The problem is formulated as a constrained minimum-cost one and it is solved by an algorithm based on a Lagrangian relaxation. The performance of the algorithm is tested with real datasets that are used to create the communication and social graphs.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Interference in a cellular network is one of the main impairments that needs to be overcome. Coordination among the Base Stations may enable the use of the interference to improve the transmission rate at the cost of increased computational complexity and more stringent backhaul and feedback requirements. Practical problems of global coordination can be reduced through clustering which, in turn, will introduce Out of Cluster Interference (OCI). OCI can seriously hamper the advantages brought by precoding techniques like Block Diagonalization (BD). In this work we propose a mixed transmission strategy using BD and Single User transmission that is able to overcome the problems introduced by the OCI, in combination with a low complexity scheduling algorithm that enables an increased transmission rate in a multiuser scenario.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Traditionally, the channel used for differential multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems is constant during one frame and changes randomly from one frame to another. This channel behavior is too simple to be realistic. In this paper, we propose a new time selective channel model for differential space-time modulation (DSTM) schemes. A sufficient number of Rayleigh channel matrices are randomly generated, and the other channel matrices are sinc interpolated according to the Nyquist's sampling theorem. The performance of DSTM schemes with two, four and eight transmit antennas are evaluated over this time selective channel model. Simulation results show slightly degraded but more realistic performance when this new channel model is used.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We consider the use of broadcast feedback of channel state information (CSI) in multi-cell cooperative networks. The salient feature of this form of feedback lies in the exploitation of the broadcast nature of the wireless medium in order to convey CSI to all transmitters in contrast with other forms of feedback exchange mechanisms relying on inter-transmitter signaling. We show that this particular design approach for feedback naturally leads to a scalable partially distributed precoding framework for multi-cell MIMO networks. A model based on channel quantization is provided to assess the performance of such a system. The analysis exhibits a novel trade-off between feedback consistency and accuracy which is specific to the multi-transmitter cooperation scenario. The optimal trade-off is explored through analysis and numerical simulations.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This work addresses the problem of asynchronous rendezvous in dynamic spectrum access (DSA) networks. Considering channel-hopping techniques in this context, two (or more) users scan through a list of available channels as to detect and establish communication with each other. In this work, we propose a new rendezvous sequence based on the vectorization of a Toeplitz matrix built from a list of channels available for rendezvous. We provide results showing that the proposed sequence ensures rendezvous, has low mean time to rendezvous (TTR) for two users, and a bounded maximum TTR. For the proposed sequence, we show that the mean TTR, maximum TTR, and the probability of rendezvous on each of the available channels have exact closed-form expressions.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, we tackle the problem of assessment of the electrical power consumption of mobile access networks at country level. We focus on radio access sites hosting 2G and 3G base stations and their corresponding technical environment. First, we enrich and validate the existing analytical model that was proposed for power consumption at sites level in a scale of a country. We show that the fine-tuned analytical modeling yields interesting results only at global level but with strong a priori constraints on the impacting parameters. Then we propose a statistical model based on linear regression to estimate the total power consumption. The statistical model is tested and validated on real measurement from a whole network of European country. We show that, the proposed model is very efficient to predict the total power consumption of the entire studied network with a small training dataset and reduced number of input parameters. Indeed, with a training set of 30 sites (6% of sites), the global power consumption of the entire network is estimated within a 10% of margin at 95% of confidence level.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The energy-efficiency of a receiver, which we measure in this work by the number of information bits conveyed per Joule of energy consumption at the receiver, is greatly influenced by the design and bit resolution of the analog-todigital converter (ADC) it employs. For a given ADC, using higher resolution leads to less quantization error in the digitized receive signal, yet requires a larger power dissipation. This trade-off can be utilized to maximize the energy-efficiency by adapting the ADC resolution according to the state of the communication channel. For a receiver with multiple antennas, the resolution of ADC associated with each antenna can be jointly adapted, leading to a multivariate integer programming problem which is difficult to solve to optimality. We propose several adaptation strategies which differ in complexity and the amount of online computations, and compare their performances based on the simulation results. Furthermore, we show that equipping the receiver with more antennas is beneficial to its energy-efficiency when only a subset of antennas associated with relatively good channel conditions is chosen for reception, and an appropriate ADC resolution is employed for the quantization of receive signals. As the improvement in energy-efficiency falls off with increasing number of antennas, a cost-effective antenna number can be determined by the receiver, depending on the application scenario and the physical limitations on the device.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, the performance of generalised spatial modulation (GSM) using large scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is analysed from an information-theoretic point of view. The analysis is extended to account for the average bit error ratio (ABER). We introduce a simple model for the capacity which allows us to derive a closed-form expression for the capacity of GSM. This is achieved by modelling GSM as two independent sources of information, where we show that GSM has the potential to achieve the capacity of MIMO systems. Moreover, using Monte-Carlo simulation for link-level mutual information, it is shown that the theoretical limit can be reached with practical signal constellations in operationally important signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regions. Furthermore, the ABER performance of GSM is analysed in this paper, and a tight upper bound for correlated and uncorrelated, Rayleigh and Rician channels is derived. Finally, the performance of GSM is validated through Monte Carlo simulations and compared with the performance of spatial modulation (SM). It is shown that GSM outperforms SM by up to 3.5 dB while the same low complexity of SM is retained. Specifically, the complexity is equal to that of single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems. Moreover, a further advantage of SM is maintained which is that only a single radio frequency (RF) chain is required. Thus, GSM is a perfect candidate for large scale MIMO systems.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper discusses whether the gains of Cooperative Spectrum Leasing (CSL) using third-party standard LTEA relays (with the current version of the standard) are worth the implementation effort. We evaluate the increment in spectral efficiency due to the introduction of relays that receive leased spectral resources as a reward. Our results show that CSL may obtain cumulative gains from the aggregation of many candidate relays, but the improvement is moderate. Therefore, CSL may remain a supporting solution for niche applications such as low throughput static M2M applications until new versions of the standard create the conditions for a broader use.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The integration of picocells in cellular networks is a cornerstone for 4G cellular networks as a low power, low cost solution to offer high data rates to outdoor customers and simultaneously reduce the load of the macrocellular network. However, the massive and unplanned deployment of picocells will diminish their performance due to severe interference from the macrocells. In this paper, an efficient power allocation scheme is proposed, in which the downlink power of macro base stations (BSs) is optimized aiming at maximizing picocells sum-rate. The non-convex optimization problem is reformulated as a difference of two concave functions and the branch and bound (B&B) algorithm is applied to find the optimum numerically. The impact of deploying a number of pico BSs on the capacity and energy efficiency measured by [bit/s/W] is investigated. The numerical results show that the total capacity improves as the number of pico BSs increases. As the number of pico BSs exceeds a certain threshold, the energy efficiency decreases followed by a marginal increase in the total capacity. Moreover, the proposed scheme outperforms other sub-optimum power allocation schemes in terms of making more pico BSs attain the required capacity to improve the energy efficiency.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, interference alignment (IA) is utilized to obtain an efficient and fair resource allocation algorithm in MIMO cognitive radio (CR) systems. In the proposed algorithm, IA enables all secondary users to share the available spectrum without affecting the quality-of-service of the primary system. The considered methodology increases the total degrees-of-freedom of the CR systems and achieves fairness among CR users. An optimal power allocation based on IA is formulated in order to maximize the total sum-rate while keeping the interference introduced to the primary system lower than the prescribed interference threshold. Furthermore, a sub-optimal power allocation scheme is proposed to overcome the high computational complexity of the optimal scheme. Simulations reveal that IA technique achieves significant sum-rate increase of CR systems compared to frequency division multiple access (FDMA) CR systems. Moreover, the sub-optimal algorithm approaches the optimal sum-rate performance.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, a recent new metric for the connectivity evaluation in finite wireless networks is employed and properly modified in order to calculate the connected probability under Inverse Gaussian (IG) correlated shadowing channels. This metric is based on spanning trees and can incorporate the impact of fading channels in connectivity assessment. In addition, a new model based on Inverse Gaussian and Bivariate Inverse Gaussian distribution is proposed for approximating the statistical behavior of Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) for both uncorrelated and correlated channels respectively. It is worth mentioning that IG distribution is used for the first time in connectivity evaluation models. In the proposed methodology the random structure of a real wireless multi-hop network is also taken under consideration. Finally, the connectivity performance is investigated under the proposed methodology.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[For smart home systems, simple single carrier wireless transmission systems with small bandwidth are used. The operation range and the reliability of these systems are limited due to effects of the indoor multipath propagation environment. Technologies without any or with long term frequency agility only cannot prevent link failures due to deep fades and fast fading. Common frequency hopping protocols change the channel continuously without consideration of the actual channel quality. Furthermore, they require regular frame exchange for synchronization, but in home automation data traffic occurs only very sporadic. In this paper, we focus on a system, which utilizes good channels and avoids unnecessary overhead, but at the same time is able to use alternative channels in case of a deep fades. The optimal number of channels for the 2.4 GHz range is identified. Furthermore, different protocols for the initial connection setup are compared.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Signaling schemes in cognitive radio systems have to meet different objectives. Apart from sensing broad-band non-stationary signal spectra, dynamic spectrum access has to be implemented with affordable implementation effort. Here, discrete Fourier transform (DFT) modulated filter banks (FBs) are a suitable means to provide high time-frequency (TF) resolution for spectral estimation with the required efficient spectrum access for data transmission. However, a low implementation effort requiring pulses with small temporal support to be used in the DFT filter bank usually results in bad resolution properties in the TF domain. Furthermore, the limitation of self-interference in DFT FBs used for dynamic spectrum access has an impact on the implementation effort of the overall transceiver which simultaneously has to take into account external interference for data transmission. In this paper, we consider the design of DFT modulated FBs for the aforementioned contradicting requirements of high resolution capabilities, efficient spectrum access and implementation effort for an additive white Gaussian channel. A performance comparison is drawn for four designs which shows the simplicity of the approach and its capability to be easily extended to fading channels.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Conventional cellular systems are dimensioned according to a worst case scenario, and they are designed to ensure ubiquitous coverage with an always-present wireless channel irrespective of the spatial and temporal demand of service. A more energy conscious approach will require an adaptive system with a minimum amount of overhead that is available at all locations and all times but becomes functional only when needed. This approach suggests a new clean slate system architecture with a logical separation between the ability to establish availability of the network and the ability to provide functionality or service. Focusing on the physical layer frame of such an architecture, this paper discusses and formulates the overhead reduction that can be achieved in next generation cellular systems as compared with the Long Term Evolution (LTE). Considering channel estimation as a performance metric whilst conforming to time and frequency constraints of pilots spacing, we show that the overhead gain does not come at the expense of performance degradation.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose a method to construct the modified Tanner graphs for systematic Luby transform (LT) codes. The modified Tanner graph is drawn in terms of bit nodes and check nodes, instead of encoding nodes and information nodes as in the conventional Tanner graphs for LT codes. By using this modified Tanner graph, we can use a more simplified soft iterative decoding algorithm, and also the decoding performance can be improved, compared to the conventional method. Most importantly, we can simply derive the corresponding parity check equation with the modified Tanner graph, and thus the iterative decoding process can be terminated easily. The average number of iterations can be largely reduced. Simulation results in this paper reveal that our proposed method can achieve better performance than the conventional iterative soft decoding with much less complexity.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[A relay in a network without any centralized controlling entity is subject to a lack of global network state knowledge. The only information that it can gain comes from its closest neighbors. This is the typical situation in wireless multi-node networks with many sources, destinations and relays. Our proposal assumes such a network that we call a cloud since it provides a service, reliable communication, to the network users - sources and destinations. The service is provided via a uniform interface and the users should not be involved or even interested in the internal cloud organization. This allows the user nodes to behave more or less selfishly. All of the tasks associated with service providing are delegated to the cloud and are solved by a distributed approach, as much as possible, without any controlling node. A technique known as Wireless Physical Layer Network Coding (WPLNC) is a potential enabling technology for such networks. In this paper a Software Defined Radio (SDR) implementation based on an OFDM physical layer of one of the algorithms that equips each network node with all the information necessary to start the WPLNC communication is presented.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[One of the major features to be developed in 3GPP Release 12 is direct Device-to-Device (aka D2D) communication, as a support for so-called 3GPP Proximity Services (or ProSe). The main advantage of using D2D communication in 3GPP networks is the provision of higher data rates and radio resource usage rates, thanks to the proximity of communicating users. This paper reports a feasibility study of cellular-D2D reuse of radio resource, i.e. simultaneous use for cellular and D2D links, in the context of an LTE network. Based on real constraints from recent 3GPP standardization activities, the paper investigates the conditions for such an allocation scheme to serve the expected Quality of Service (QoS) on both links. In this paper interference constraints are identified along with a possible associated LTE system design (i.e. LTE network and User Equipments), including Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) and related protocols. Finally, results from simulation are shown and analyzed to draw measurable conclusions expressed in terms of probability of reuse.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The rapid deployment and adoption of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications pose significant challenges to the current cellular network with its features and traffic patterns being significantly different from conventional Human-to-Human (H2H) communications. In particular, the signaling channels can easily get congested due to simultaneous network access from massive M2M devices. For successful integration of M2M communications into the cellular network, we propose an optimization mechanism, which can greatly reduce the congestion probability as well as the amount of network signaling incurred from massive M2M communications. The proposed approach applies an efficient resource coordination scheme to the Random Access Channel (RACH), where signaling process within a group of related M2M devices is well handled, meanwhile preventing unnecessary recurring data transmissions with substantially reduced additional signaling overhead. Proposals on the framework of the proposed scheme are presented. Results show that our approach provides significant improvement in mitigating congestion and network overload particularly in case of large numbers of M2M devices deployed within a cell.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We consider linear mapping functions for physical layer network coding (PNC), using a generalised description of linear mapping on some arbitrary algebraic structure. We show that a ring is a sufficient structure for this purpose, and consider the requirements for the coefficients used in the linear functions. We consider both rings based on integers and rings based on binary matrices. We then consider the performance of the mappings in the two-way relay channel using QPSK as an example, and evaluate the information loss in terms of the equivocation at the destination as a function of the relative fading of the two channels. Hence we determine the outage probability of the schemes.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has become one of the key techniques in today's wireless communications. Although recently wireless communications are developing very fast, the mobility of those systems often is limited. In time-variant channels moving transmitters and receivers create frequency shifts (Doppler effect) which destroy the orthogonality of the subcarriers. In this paper we propose a high-mobility feature: A Doppler compensation for multipleinput and single-output (MISO) OFDM systems which can be implemented with low complexity based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). At the end, we compare different channel estimation algorithms and show that based on the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm the channel can be estimated for the proposed Doppler compensation algorithm which can be implemented accurately based on the FFT.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We investigate the minimum energy routing problem in cooperative multi-hop networks, where a single source communicates to a single destination assisted by several multi-hop relays that can accumulate information from retransmissions. Solving the minimum sum transmitter power problem for a multi-hop network implies finding the optimal resource allocation and transmission order (path). We address this problem by first deriving the path weight function which returns the minimum energy for given path. This function is found to admit a useful duality property which, basically, let us to define two recursive computations of the path weight using the intermediate path weights to each relay, either from the source (forward) or from the destination (backward). We propose new heuristics path discovering algorithms that make use of the duality property and are based on Dijkstra's algorithm.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, we consider the problem of blind reconstruction of binary cyclic codes from a received sequence of noise affected codewords. Blind reconstruction of a cyclic code is equivalent to identifying its generator polynomial. We identify the generator polynomial by finding its irreducible factors and their respective multiplicities. We derive syndrome distributions of the received vectors when the divisor polynomial is a factor of the generator polynomial and when it is not a factor. These distributions are used to construct a Neyman-Pearson hypothesis test to distinguish between factors and non-factors of the generator polynomial.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Fast convolution processing has recently been proposed as an efficient approach for implementing filter bank multicarrier systems with good spectral containment and high flexibility in adjusting the subchannel bandwidths and center frequencies. These features make fast convolution filter banks (FC-FBs) a particularly interesting choice for multicarrier transmission in challenging radio scenarios like dynamic spectrum access, cognitive radio, and fragmented spectrum use. In this contribution, the target is to compare the performance of the time-domain equalizer with the frequency-domain equalizer implemented through subcarrier processing in LTE-like multicarrier systems. It is shown that integrating the equalization functions with the FC-FB processing leads to an efficient overall implementation in terms of performance and computational complexity.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[IEEE 802.15.6 Machine-to-Machine (M2M)1 applications require reliable communications at lowenergy consumption. This fact makes BCH codes an interesting option for IEEE 802.15.6 communications since their algebraic nature permit them to obtain the positions of the erroneous bits with mathematical equations of reduced complexity. Moreover, if the decoder is designed with knowledge about i) Galois Field properties ii) Frame Structure and iii) Cross-layer data, then it is possible to speed up all the stages BCH's decoder. Thus the obtained hard-BCH decoder is very computational efficient, which permits to implement practical soft-BCH decoders. Additionally, this work also compares the strategies for estimating the true WER based on Syndromes and Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC). The results show that it is possible to reduce the processing time of the Chien's search till two decimal scales which permit to obtain practical soft-BCH decoders. The estimation of the true WER using CRCs is much better than the Syndromebased whereas the use of both strategies obtains a WER quite close to the true one.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Interference alignment (IA) gives a promise to achieve the maximum degrees of freedom of K-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels. This theoretical result can be achieved under ideal channels. In practice, the prospective IA sum-rate may not always be achievable, particularly in indoor environments. For this reason, an acceptable sum-rate of IA in MIMO orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) interference channels was obtained in the literature by increasing the separation between antennas to 2 lambda and pre-allocating the user-pairs in specific setups in order to minimize the correlation between channels. In this paper, we propose to apply transmit antenna selection to MIMO-OFDM IA systems either through bulk or per-subcarrier selection, aiming at improving MIMO-OFDM IA systems sum-rate under real-world channel circumstances, while keeping the minimum antenna separation of 0.5 lambda. Furthermore, a simplified antenna selection scheme is proposed for correlated channels, which enhances MIMO-OFDM IA sum-rate with simple selection process and minimal hardware cost. Accordingly, the practical feasibility of MIMO-OFDM IA systems is significantly increased by antenna selection in real-world scenarios. This has been verified using simulation that considers channel realizations that characterize a real-world multi-user indoor environment.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In order to achieve the enhancement in the throughput and the coverage for cellular communication, femtocell is a viable solution. Moreover, self-organization is proved to be an attractive option because of the uncertain deployment of femtocells. In this study, we are projecting the docitive Q-learning mechanism for the joint resource allocation and power control in femtocell network. Additionally, the comparison is carried out with the independent Q-learning mechanism. The problem function is modeled as the maximization of femtocells capacity while maintaining the quality of service requirement of macrousers. The analysis of the considered learning mechanisms, docitive and independent, on the femtocells capacity and network capacity is analyzed in terms of convergence and femtocells density. Simulation results validate the better performance of proposed docitive Q-learning as compared to its counterpart.]]></abstract>

Though this paper focuses on energy consumption per successfully transmitted packet as the primary QoS metric, we also examine how the different QoS metrics, such as throughput and delay, also interact with energy consumption, and show how trade-offs can be effected among them. The approach combines a queueing theoretic analysis with the sensing and error control effects in the channel in the presence of interfering communications.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Broadcasting systems have to deal with channel variability in order to offer the best spectral efficiency to the receivers. However, the transmission parameters that maximise the spectral efficiency generally leads to a large link unavailability. In this paper, we study analytically the tradeoff between spectral efficiency and coverage for various channel resource allocation strategies when broadcasting two services. More precisely, we consider the following strategies: time sharing, hierarchical modulation and bit division multiplexing. Our main contribution is the combination of bit division multiplexing with non-uniform QAM to improve the performance of broadcasting systems. The results show that this scheme outperforms all the previous channel resource allocation strategies.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Opportunistic communications have been recently proposed as a key strategy for offloading traffic from 3G/4G cellular networks, which is particularly beneficial in case of crowded areas where many users are interested in similar contents. To conserve energy, duty cycling schemes are typically applied, and therefore contacts between nodes may become intermittent and sporadic also in dense networks. It is thus of paramount importance to accurately tune the duty cycling policy in order to meet energy requirements without compromising the quality of communications. In this paper, building upon a model of duty cycling in opportunistic networks that we have validated in a previous work, we study how to optimise the value of the duty cycle in order to provide probabilistic guarantees on the delay experienced by messages. More specifically, for a broad range of end-to-end delay distributions, we provide closed-form approximated solutions for deriving the optimal duty cycle such that the probability that the delay is smaller than a target value z is greater than or equal to a configurable probability p.]]></abstract>

The abstraction allows a straightforward modelling of different MIMO transmission schemes as well as the impact of different scheduling schemes. The parameters presented are obtained by curve fitting and enable systemlevel simulations with 1.4, 5, 10 and 20 MHz bandwidth while supporting 2x2, 4x2 and 4x4 MIMO transmissions with either a Round-Robin or Best CQI scheduling approach.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Bluetooth low energy(BTLE) is an emerging lowpower wireless communication technology which is expected to be of great potential in the next few years. In this paper, we propose several empirical propagation models for BTLE in different conditions: indoor/outdoor, line-of-sight (LOS) / non-line-of-sight (NLOS). Then we compare the propagation characteristics between BTLE and WiFi. It is demonstrated in our experiments that BTLE propagation model can better relate RSSI to range than WiFi, which indicates that BTLE can be more accurate when used in localization scenarios. Extensive experiments in indoor environments have been conducted to explicitly compare the localization accuracy between BTLE and WiFi with nearly identical external environments and conditions. BTLE is proved to be more accurate than WiFi by around 27 percent. We also discuss various underlying reasons why BTLE outperforms WiFi in localization scenarios. We believe that such an accurate and low-cost technique will enable practical and ubiquitous indoor localization.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The IEEE 802.15.4 standard uses carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) algorithm as the medium access mechanism, which employs a binary exponential backoff (BEB) mechanism to control the access of nodes to the wireless medium. One of the main drawbacks of this algorithm is that it does not support network self-adaptivity. It updates the length of the backoff period in a deterministic manner without taking into consideration the actual status of the communication channel. The other drawback is that it does not support differentiated services. All the nodes are treated the same and each node has the same opportunity to access the medium. It seems to be quite fair when the nodes have the same priority level, but if service differentiation is considered, this method should be adjusted to overcome this shortcoming. We address these problems by proposing an adaptive priority-based service-differentiation CSMA/CA algorithm (APB-CSMA/CA) for differentiated services for IEEE 802.15.4. The proposed algorithm includes two mechanisms, 1) adaptive backoff mechanism. The nodes can dynamically adjust the backoff period according to the actual status of current network. 2) priority-based servicedifferentiation mechanism. In this mechanism, different parameters are given to different classes of services to provide multi-levels differentiated services. The results of OMnet++ simulation indicate that the proposed mechanism has a good result in mean end-to-end delay and collision probability.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, a precoding scheme for interference mitigation based only on local channel state information is proposed for downlink multicell multiantenna systems with joint transmission. The investigated scheme places interference components at the receivers coming from the different transmitters in predefined subspaces, so that they are completely or approximately cancelled. It is shown how in certain scenarios of practical interest this strategy exploits better the available degrees-of-freedom in the system, with very little or practically no additional coordination effort compared with the related results from the literature.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Fairness is a crucial aspect for resource allocation in wireless systems, particularly in the downlink of 4G Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)-based systems. Therefore, it would be interesting for network operators to have tools to manage fairness in their systems. This work describes the utility-based beta-rule, which is a flexible resource allocation framework based on utility theory that is able to control delaybased fairness in a scenario with real time services in an OFDMAbased system. Not only can this framework be designed to work as well-known classical policies found in the literature, but also as an adaptive policy, which is able to meet a desired system fairness target. System-level simulations demonstrate that the adaptive policy is able to guarantee a fairness requirement by dynamically adapting a fairness-controlling parameter in the subcarrier assignment algorithm. It also presents better results than the classical policies in terms of cell capacity and user satisfaction.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[The radio duty cycle (RDC) of wireless sensor nodes can be considered as a crucial factor that determines the wireless sensor network (WSN) lifetime and its service availability. Clustering would be a preferable solution to minimize node radio duty cycle by electing multiple cluster heads (CHs) around the network to schedule node transmissions and collect readings. This paper presents a mesh-under cluster-based routing (MUCBR) protocol that will divide the sensor network into multiple clusters and perform the routing function within the IEEE 802.15.4 platform. MUCBR is implemented via the Contiki operating system (OS). It reschedules the structure of the 802.15.4 standard in order to reduce the RDC of the sensor nodes and minimize the number of collisions. The election of the CHs is density-aware and determined by the routing direction inside the network which in turn reduces the number of hops and minimizes the number of collisions caused by the existence of multiple CHs in a single area. The proposed MUCBR manages to achieve a RDC of 0.08% for non-CH nodes and 1.3% for CH nodes while reducing the impact of collision by 40% as compared to the 802.15.4 standard.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, we consider the problem of improving the percentage of satisfied users in the downlink of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system that provides non-real time services. Therefore, we propose an utilitybased scheduling algorithm that uses a sigmoidal utility function combined with Fixed Switching Beamforming (FSB) to exploit several kinds of diversity, such as time, frequency, space and multi-user, in order to achieve the pursued objective. System-level simulation results demonstrate that there is an optimal number of spatial beams to be used by FSB, and that the proposed joint scheduling and beamforming provides higher user satisfaction than other classical techniques found in the literature.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper considers the coexistence of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Human-to-Human (H2H) based traffic sharing the Random Access Channel (RACH) of an existing cellular network. A novel combined RACH access scheme is proposed to control M2M traffic in order to reduce its impact on a cellular network. A Q-learning RACH access scheme (QL-RACH) which allows interaction of M2M with H2H via a Slotted Aloha RACH access (SA-RACH) scheme is presented. The QL-RACH access scheme uses an intelligent slot assignment strategy in order to avoid collisions amongst the M2M users and is generic and compatible with all cellular network standards. The learning is applied so that no central entity is involved in the slot selection process, to avoid tampering with the existing network standards. Simulation results show that this approach overcomes the negative impact of M2M traffic on existing H2H traffic in the RACH access contest and improves the total RACH-throughput to 55%.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper deals with the joint transmission of energy and information in multiuser systems, in particular, in a two-user symmetric interference channel. It is assumed that each receiver can be either in the information decoding (ID) mode, or in the energy harvesting (EH) mode at any time instant. In the ID mode, information-carrying signals from the other transmitter is considered as noise, while energy-carrying signals can be ignored owing to their known structure. In the EH mode, a receiver can harvest energy from the energy-carrying signal transmitted by its own transmitter as well as from the interfering signal from the other transmitter, be it an information or an energy-carrying signal; which is called interference harvesting. The transmission scheme is optimized in order to maximize the throughput while satisfying a constraint on the minimum amount of average harvested power by each receiver, which might model the power required by the receiver for processing and decoding the information-carrying signals. This problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem which can be efficiently solved, and provides insights on the optimal transmission scheme with the help of numerical simulations.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are made up of small energy-constrained sensor nodes. In our study, the network is sub-divided into groups of sensor nodes called clusters, and the nodes in same cluster send data to its own cluster-head called Gateway. Major issue is raised to be the Gateway unavailability due to energy depletion or hard-failure, because the Sink losses the communication with the whole cluster. This paper presents a novel cluster-head selection approach to extend network lifetime and reliability by taking obstacle-aware criteria into consideration. This approach allows selecting the most appropriate sensor node to become cluster head. Simulation results show significant results by reducing 93% the number of lost packets in the network, hence improving the network throughput up to 53%. Additionally, our solution extends the network lifetime to 11%.]]></abstract>

In particular, we apply this approach within a convergent multilayer packet-optical aggregation network in order to provide QoS support to the transport of packet services regardless of the access technology. As a proof of concept of our approach, we developed a Fixed Mobile Convergence testbed that integrates the LTE-EPC LENA emulator and the multi-layer ADRENALINE testbed. We describe and experimentally validate how this integration is done on the data plane to provide the end-to-end transport of LTE mobile services through the packet-optical aggregation network.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) is a novel filtered multicarrier transmission scheme that provides the flexibility required by 5G applications. Its robustness against fading multipath environments can be increased by space-time coding (STC) at the transmitter when the receiver complexity should be kept minimal. In this paper we investigate the application of the Alamouti-STC in GFDM with a maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver. We show the application to be straight-forward in contrast to the difficulties that arise in FBMC/OQAM due to its OQAM-modulation. The performance is evaluated by comparing coded GFDM and OFDM transmissions in frequency-selective fading channels.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper proposes an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay scheme in which the first transmission link (from source to relay) employs modified transmit antenna selection (TAS)/orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) that provides reduced feedback-rate and robust error performance in the presence of feedback errors (FEs) when compared to the conventional TAS/OSTBC (C-TAS/OSTBC), and the second link (from relay to destination) performs maximal-ratio combining at the destination node. The error probability performance of the proposed dual-hop AF relay scheme in Nakagami fading channels has been examined via Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, the approximate error probability expressions related to the investigated scheme have been derived by using high signal-to-noise (SNR) approaches. We have shown that the modified TAS/OSTBC (M-TAS/OSTBC) scheme employed at the first transmission link provides full diversity order and considerable error performance as the C-TAS/OSTBC scheme in ideal feedback cases and also achieves more robust error performance in the presence of erroneous-feedback channels facing both fading effect and additive white Gaussian noise. Thus, by employing the M-TAS/OSTBC scheme in the first hop, the overall error performance of the dual-hop AF relay scheme has been enhanced that would result in reductions on the values of average SNR required to achieve a specified symbol error rate goal.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Small cells are low cost solutions that address effectively the growing traffic demands, enhancing the capacity of Radio Access Networks (RANs) at particular locations. In this paper, we combine the attributes of carrier aggregation with multi-path transport considering a cell-less architecture introduced by virtual evolved NodeBs (eNBs) as established in the iJoin project. A virtual eNB is formed by a cloud unit referred to as RAN as a Service (RANaaS) and a set of small cells. The RANaaS can flexibly centralize and handle selected RAN functionalities depending on the backhaul characteristics and/or other network optimization targets, e.g. load balancing. By coupling selected carriers and paths in a multi-connectivity environment, RAN and backhaul resources may be jointly allocated to users based on Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, considering channel conditions, backhaul load and the application type. In exploiting path diversity with increased inter-path control and coordination, this paper introduces a combined carrier/transport proxy function, located on the RANaaS in order to shorten the multi-path distance. Such a proxy function consists of a classifier, which categorizes carriers based-on QoS, and a state prediction process that influences the eNB scheduler to allocate carriers considering network resources across the RAN and backhaul. In the absence of a multi-path proxy, a direct end host based seeding token mechanism is also analyzed considering the impact and requirements on the RAN.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[Practical linear precoding methods are proposed for High Throughput GEO Satellite systems operating in the Ka band for DVB-S2 communications. The main focus is on implementation issues relevant to multiuser DVB-S2 frames. Since different users must be addressed by the same precoding matrix at the transmitter, the standard precoding algorithms do not apply directly but need to be adapted. Geographic user clustering is proposed to take this into account. Additional implementation constraints are accounted for, including CSIR estimation, outdated CSIT, and oscillator phase noise. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the system trade-offs and the achievable throughput gains available from linear precoding.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This1 paper presents and evaluates a decentralized beamforming design for inter-cell interference management that is highly recommended in Time Division Duplex (TDD) cellular network deployments and interference limited scenarios. The inter-cell interference mitigation in the downlink (DL) is done in a decentralized manner by sensing the Sounding Reference Signals (SRS) sent by user equipments (UEs) associated to neighboring evolved Node Bs (eNBs). The proposed technique exploits the reciprocity of the propagation radio channels, an adequate link adaptation in the uplink and a wise coordination of the SRS transmissions. In this regard, multiple methods are proposed to implement the proposed Beamforming with Coordinated Sounding (BF-CoS) in a 3GPP LTE-Advanced based network. Simulation results show significant performance gains in terms of user packet throughput with respect to no coordination schemes, without increasing the overhead and complexity because of coordination. The largest relative gains are obtained for medium-to-high traffic loads and for denser deployments.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[We consider a correlated multiuser (MU) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink channel in which many heterogeneous users have different channel qualities (i.e., different path-losses) to a base station (BS) equipped with a large antenna array. Using the theory of extreme values of regularly varying functions, we characterize the scaling laws of the achievable sum-rate of the system, when both numbers of BS antennas and users grow large. We then prove that for a large number of users, a simple user scheduling that chooses the users with the largest instantaneous channel vector norms based on the global channel state information (CSI) can significantly improve the achievable system sum-rate. Finally, since the scheduling method needs the global CSI estimate to operate, we propose an efficient algorithm based on low-rank matrix approximation to estimate the global CSI with a moderate number of training signals. Analysis and numerical simulations show that the proposed scheme provides favourable results in terms of system sum-rate performance and computational complexity.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[This paper addresses the application of filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) systems to multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels. In particular, it is investigated the FBMC modulation based on OQAM, known as FBMC/OQAM. Existing solutions reveal that FBMC/OQAM remains competitive with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique when the number of streams (S), transmit antennas (NT ) and receive antennas (NR) are related as follows: S = min(NT ,NR). State-of-the-art techniques fail to achieve satisfactory results in FBMC/OQAM systems when S < min(NT ,NR). That is because the strongest spatial subchannels exhibit higher gains in MIMO-OFDM than in existing MIMO-FBMC/OQAM systems. To determine if FBMC/OQAM can be successfully applied when strict inequality holds, this paper provides experimental performance bounds, which can be assumed to approximate the optimal performance. In this sense, numerical results show that FBMC/OQAM is able to slightly outperform OFDM when S < min(NT ,NR) by attenuating the residual interference 20 dB below the equalized noise. This insightful information could be used in the design process of future techniques to approach the experimental performance bounds.]]></abstract>

While Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has been designed for identification purposes, it can also be used for location tracking purposes. This paper presents an RFID-based location tracking system using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network architecture and investigates location estimation methods for the system. In summary, this paper makes three major contributions. First, the proposed system using a P2P architecture can facilitate system setup and management. Second, we investigate some position estimation methods using radio signal strength, reference tags, and a simple formula with dynamic parameters calibration for the positioning system. Third, we present experimental results, which give valuable insights into the design of an RFID-based position estimation system.]]></abstract>

<abstract><![CDATA[In this paper, a novel decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) with progressive group detection (PGD) assistance is proposed for the downlink of synchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) multiuser wireless systems. The proposed DFE operates on chip-level to accommodate wideband systems employing long scrambling codes over frequency-selective channels. PGD is a near-maximum likelihood (ML) detection technique that spans and intelligently prunes the set of possible transmit-symbol combinations, and provides a set of the most probable combinations as interim hypotheses for symbol-decisions to the DFE in order to circumvent the initial chip-decisions availability problem and avert faulty feedback. The receiver exhibits an iterative architecture to further enhance the performance. Simulation results for the 3GPP high-speed packet access (HSPA) show that the proposed receiver outperforms linear and DFE receivers found in literature, and provides substantial performance gains that scale with complexity. The proposed receiver's performance approaches that of the single-code ideal DFE.]]></abstract>
